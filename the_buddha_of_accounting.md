title: The Buddha of Accounting

He sits beneath the bodhi tree as dawn rises behind him. It filters through the leaves and dapples light across his tweed jacket's muted grey, as spring grass, fresh and full of vitality after the winter thaw, spreads forever around him. A light wind plays with his short hair and tie, whose simple black designs stand out from the flowing shades and shapes of the boundless earth about him. His eyes are closed: he has been contemplating the Johnson account for days, fasting beneath the bodhi tree. But now he opens them. Now he has crossed the final barrier.

He raises his hand, clasped in a fist. "What is net income?" He uncurls his fingers...

"But the difference of revenue, and expense?"

...revealing a single precious dollar.

"We face factors legion, but none can exist without the other."

He raises his other hand to lay open-faced at his side.

"Accounts payable is meaningless" ...as a leaf from the bodhi drifts into his empty palm... "without accounts receivable."
