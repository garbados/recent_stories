title: Indomitable

We are three-dimensional beings,

In an 11-dimensional universe.

We are constrained

by space,

and time,

forces which other elements of the universe --

electrons,

gravitons,

tachyons --

have no concern for.

I imagine it will be necessary

To consciously modify the species

In order to perceive and manipulate

That which our current manifestations cannot.

Would doing so make us less human?

Yes.

I maintain nevertheless

that it is the indomitable human spirit

which will compel us to do so.

The question then becomes:

will that spirit remain

after?
