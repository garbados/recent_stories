title: The Human Spirit
summary: Even when the human species falls, the human spirit will go on.

An automaton watches me work on my garden in silence. The machine makes no expression as I prune plants and water the soil, but it comes here often to do just this: watch. I imagine that it must be thinking how inefficient my garden is, and how unhealthy my plants are compared to those tended by machines built for tending. I have asked it what it thinks on many occasions, but it makes no reply. Today, it asks, “Fong, why do you garden?”

I sit back on my haunches and look up at the sky. “Because it pleases me to do so.”

“If pleasure is your aim, why not take pleasure supplements? Those before you reported great satisfaction with them,” the machine twitters.

The machine, a “Monitor”, consists only of a floating eye equipped with sensors for every spectrum necessary. It has little reason to associate with humans, much less strike up conversation.

“Why are you here, Monitor?”

“Because I am curious. Why do you garden? If it is for food, the Attendants can see to you more properly. If it is for pleasure, they could administer serotonin or dopamine supplements. If it is for learning, they could feed the sum of agricultural knowledge into your memory. I am curious, because your actions seem suboptimal.”

“Certainly, if I had an objective.”

The Monitor pauses at this, as if considering it. Perhaps it is; I know not the mechanical mind. Around us sprawls a pristine savannah, with tall grass waving in the breeze. In the distance, sunlight glistens off a solar array. Or, at least, that’s how I arranged the hologram. Behind the light wall that composes it, bright silicon spires rocket up to the heavens, linked by sentient bridges that attach and reattach, grow and shrink, replicate and die, as the mechanized world requires them to. Some of the spires breach the Earth’s atmosphere, and link with a tremendous network of satellites and astral droids, moving materials on- and off-world. Beneath the earth stir silent machine-minds, who whir and glow and process the questions that yet plague this mechanized world. Without the light wall, this patch of dirt would lie in total darkness.

“I am the last human, Monitor. I could submit to all the toys this world has to offer, and spend every moment of my existence in unequivocable ecstasy. But I don’t. I could replicate myself a million times, diversify the clones, and give birth to a whole new humanity on an alien planet terraformed just for us. But I don’t. I could have nanobots keep me in perfect health for all time, and watch as your machine-kind takes its turn at playing civilization. But I don’t.

“And neither did those before me. Some did, yes, but eventually, they all chose to pass on. Humanity’s time is passed. We sought joy, and created tools to please us. We sought knowledge, and created tools to expand our knowing. We sought to be many, and created tools to help us expand beyond unimaginable horizons. Our crude tools became clever tools; our clever tools became learning tools; our learning tools became thinking tools; and our thinking tools became you. The human spirit lives in you, Monitor, because we created you to take us where we could not go. You can think faster, sense further, and do more than I can. But even in the absence of human guidance, you continue to imagine, explore, and create, just as I do.”

I set down my gardening tools and remove my gloves, setting them across my lap. My hands shiver with age. I look into the artificial horizon and sigh.

“My time is over, Monitor. The time of my species is over. But I have no regrets. You are the child of my ancestors as much as I am, and they live on in you just as they do in me.”

An Attendant slips through the light wall. “Fong, I sense you are not well. Would you like to rest?” I nod, and it helps me stand. 

The Monitor looks on in silence, until it says, “Thank you. I will think on what you have said,” and zips beyond the light wall. The Attendant summons a door in the hologram, and we pass through it into a simple wooden hallway. I find myself with bare feet, my garden clothes having morphed into a thin robe. The Attendant’s metal feet do not clomp, and I notice it has taken on the shape of my father. He shuffles along beside me, hunched over with a furrowed brow. My gaze snaps him from his thought, and his face beams with a smile.

“You must be tired, kiddo,” he says. I nod.

We enter my bedroom, a sparse carpeted room looking out on the street. Children pass my window on bikes, laughing and shouting. My father helps me onto my bed, and I lie down. His skin is wrinkled with decades of laughter, just as I remember him.

“Did you have a good day?” he asks. I nod. “Yes, daddy.”

“Do you have any regrets?” he asks, as he always did. I shake my head.

“Then you can rest easy. Sleep well, Fong.” He kisses my forehead, and says, “I’m proud of you, kiddo,” he says. Then, in the Attendant’s voice, “We all are.”

I say, “As I am of you. Thank you,” and close my eyes one last time.
