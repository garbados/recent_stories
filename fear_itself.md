title: Fear Itself

Weariness.

A crime scene like that leaves you drained. All the cops on the scene, they'd seemed hardened against it, but Charles could see in every one of them, they would weep when they got home. They would go to their wives and children, kiss them and hold them, and pray to whatever goodness remained in the world that nothing like what they had seen would ever taint the innocence of their loved ones.

"See you tomorrow, Charles," fellow detective and carpool driver Samuel Burns stopped the car outside Charles Anderson's tenament. He sighed and got out of the car, and Sam drove away. He trudged inside the drab, sagging building, grey paint on grey blocks against a grey sky, all swathed in midnight black and splashed with the streetlight's orange glow that only seemed to cast more shadows. He climbed the stairs to his apartment, creaking and moaning beneath his feet with every step. Charles drew a smile from the sound, comparing the object's weariness to his own, and at last with a sigh got to his floor. He turned the key and stepped inside his home, closed the door and flicked on the lights.

"Oh shit," he heard.

"Who's there?"

"No one!"

Charles dropped his briefcase and rushed to the source of the voice, his living room, where he saw outside his window, clinging to the fire escape's ladder, a scruffy-looking twenty-something with Charles' TV strapped to his back. Charles looked at him with his mouth agape in disbelief at how his day could have gotten worse, and the thief stared back with a smirk and a grin.

"Too slow. See you!" he said, and slid down the ladder. Charles rushed to the window and watched the skinny thing flee into the shadows and disappear. He sighed, groaned, and tightened his fist as if to break something, but his weariness wore his anger back to nothing. He dropped his hands in resignation and went back to the door, picked up his briefcase and went to the kitchen, dropped it on the table and, moving to the next order of business, examined the refrigerator for something to eat. Finding only Tupperware full of aged and unrecognizable left-overs, he looked instead through the cupboards and drawers. Finding nothing there either, he returned to the fridge, and took out a container of what might have once been lasagna.

"Heat kills germs, right?" he thought, and tossed it in the microwave. He moved back to the kitchen table and swept the layers of newspapers, articles, reports, and all other order of literary excess to the floor with a move of his tired arm before sitting down and popping open his briefcase. More papers flew out: dictations, confessions, depositions and court records his higher-ups had shoved in his hands, all of them eager to benefit from his investigative diligence and skill, but never to reward him except with a passing thanks and another case. Charles sighed.

He sifted through the material and took out his laptop, a bulky machine he'd acquired second-hand years ago. He opened it and set it aside, waiting for it to come to life and await use, before he returned to the mess of files. He sifted through them for the one case that wouldn't leave his mind, couldn't leave his mind, not even if he wanted it to. Today's case.

"Chad Wesson, 42, a corn farmer of Myleton, awoke October 12, 2005, at 6:00 AM via alarm. He noted his wife Mary, 33, was not in bed, but thought nothing of it because she typically got up before him to make breakfast for the family. Going downstairs, he discovered there were no lights on to indicate his wife's presence. Becoming concerned, he explored the first floor, quietly so as not to wake his daughter and only child Melissa, 14. Entering the living room, he looked through the room's central window to the apple tree he planted when he bought the house, and beheld a sight so disturbing it rendered him able only to sob, vomit, urinate, and defecate where he stood, or rather where he promptly crumpled into a ball and shook for several hours. Stains at the home verified his story. At approximately 9:32 AM, Melissa found her father, saw the apple tree, and called 911. [See attached transcript of call]

"What incapacitated Mr. Wesson so, was to find his four farmhands [names and information attached] and his two neighbors [names and information attached] hanging from his apple tree, bound by their feet with their eyes gouged out, their hands dripping with their own blood from having apparently done the gouging themselves. The ropes they dangled from were pre-cut to such lengths that each man's head was level with every other's, and the rope burns on their ankles and marks on the branches above indicate they tied the ropes themselves and then dropped. No signs of struggle accompanied these six male victims. Presumed cause of death is blood loss from the eye sockets, as gravity pulled most of their bodies' blood out that way.

"The seventh victim, Chad's wife Mary, was nailed haphazardly to the tree's trunk, facing away from the tree with her arms wrenched backwards to hug the trunk. Nails pierced her palms, upper arms, deltoids, abdomen, thighs, ankles, and neck. Hammer wounds surround the nails, indicating either a struggle or great imprecision on the part of the attacker. Judging from the wide wounds resulting from her thrashing against her bonds, it is likely the former. A smashed watch found on farmhand Saul Waevyr indicates time of incident at around 5:17 AM.

"This preliminary investigation suggests sudden insanity on the part of the six male victims, acting together to kidnap Mary and murder her as an incident of their madness. From this data, the following theoretical situation can be constructed: the six male victims organized early in the morning, around 4 AM, before kidnapping Mary, silencing her somehow, and then carrying out the murder by the apple tree over the next hour. This detective recommends further investigation as no evidence suggests odd or suspicious proclivities in any of the six male victims prior to the event, and considering inconsistencies such as no reports of any hammering noises, sounds of voices from the band, (both of which Melissa should have heard, as she claims she was awake between 4 AM and 6 AM [due to nightmare]) or any indication of how Mary got from her bed with Chad to the hands of her murderers."

The microwave beeped and broke Charles' typing trance. He sighed and pushed his chair back, stood up, and moved to the microwave. He opened it to see the Tupperware steaming and, pulling it out, the food inside turned from old beyond recognition to burned beyond recognition. One problem into another, and we none the better, he thought.



Kinde loved his life. His real name was John Blaggard, but nobody knew that. His parents had died Batman-style when he was ten, killed by a trigger-happy mugger behind a theater on their night out. He didn't find out until the cops busted into his family's apartment thinking the killers were using it as a drug lab. Brilliant reasoning, fuzz. He lived as an orphan until he was twelve, when he just walked out and left, living as a street urchin for another two years until a gang boss, Mac McLarnan, caught him stealing clothes from a Laundromat to pawn - stealing his clothes, specifically - but he liked the urchin's spunk, like how when he picked up the kid by the back of the neck to take back his clothes, the kid kicked him in the nuts and ran for it. Any other gang boss he knew would have pumped his dumb head full of bullets, but in his heart he knew that, were he in the same position, he woulda kicked him in the nuts too. He tried corralling the kid, giving him a place among the gang: a home, food, friends, but the kid couldn't be convinced. So he started calling him Kinde, after that defiant black dude in that movie he thought he remembered, and it stuck. Kinde stayed a street urchin, honing his skills as a thief, eventually graduating to burglary, sometimes playing mugger, other times just a simple trickster, scaring the living daylights out of other ne'er-do-wells by posing as the cops, by leaping from the shadows with a knife at their neck, by pick pocketing them just after they'd pick pocketed someone else, or by any other means that left him laughing for days. Ten years later, now 22, he hadn't changed. Sure, he only stole what he needed, he didn't feel the need for much more, but adventure was never such a rational mistress as to leave him to the least work, and more than once he'd had to put a knife in a man to make a getaway. But, he was quick to remind anyone he told, only because he had to. His real passion was filching, like this TV.

He trotted through back alleys, his lips curled as if whistling, but along this end of the city, in these alleyways where the faintest shapes looked like bodies lying in wait for you - and a disconcerting amount of the time, they were - it generally wasn't a good idea. Especially not with a sweet flatscreen for a haul. It might have been small, sure, but he could fetch at least two days' living off it. Or go out tomorrow and fetch that money and just keep the TV for himself. Oh, the possibilities were endless!

Kinde lived in a rat-cellar of an apartment, owned by a little old lady whose mere existence in such a crime-ridden area was bizarre. But she owned the place, was there every day, extracted rent from its obviously immorally-inclined tenants, and yet still maintained the demeanor of a helpless old granny. Once when Kinde gave her the month's rent early, she baked him cookies. He sat for hours and just looked at them, like they were snowflakes in Hell, until at last hunger overcame him and the cookies promptly disappeared into his gullet.

He came out of the alley maze onto his apartment's decrepit chasm of an avenue, stuck under a jungle of skyscrapers, the tops of which housed the most esoteric of the elite. The glass walls that lined their towers reflected and refracted into a toxic green blanketing the roadways below, turning the shadows of its inhabitants into venomous apparitions stalking in their passer's wakes. Why they'd planted their fortresses here, he would never know. He was content to live in their basement with his own kind. Somewhere some shots rattled off and someone screamed.

Kinde hopped down the steps to Granny's apartments, taking out his keys and undoing the lock. He fantasized about undoing it with his lockpicks, but he'd never been able. He could crack any normal lock, break into any normal home without the inhabitants knowing anything, but here? Granny had connections, knew her stuff. She was a one-of-a-kind old person.

"Kinde! Oh, it's late, welcome home!" Granny called, sweeping out the front steps.

"Granny!" He made to hug her, but she prodded at his filthy shoes with her broom. He laughed off the embarrassment and shook his shoes outside before coming in and taking her up in an embrace, "How is my old landlord at this awful hour?"

"Oh, stop, I'm not that old. Granny's still got spunk enough in her for a few decades yet, don't you worry! But I am doing well, Kinde, thanks for asking! I like your television-- but only if you'll let me watch my soaps on that big screen!"

"Well, I don't know if I'm keeping it, but if I do, Granny, the clunker's all yours," Kinde said and half-strode, half-pranced down the rest of the hall to his door. He twisted the key and the door clicked, falling open. Light seeped into his barren hovel, decorated by what things he didn't have the energy to pawn: a couch, a mattress, some blankets, a radio, a bowl, a metal spork. He bent down and flicked on the floor lamp by the door, and its yellow haze gushed over the room. He entered and carefully unwrapped himself from his haul, setting it down by his mattress. He took the cords sticking out of the back and plugged them into the wall as best as he could figure before flopping back onto his mattress. Only then did he notice the sticky note on the screen.



I SAW YOU AT THE HOUSE TODAY

LOOKING US OVER

STOP IT, DON'T COME

IF YOU WANT TO LIVE



Kinde shivered where he sat. He was glad his door was still open, but jumped when Granny had appeared there suddenly and silently. She smiled wide enough that her eyes closed, then bent back down and kept sweeping the hall.

He took the note up and looked at it closer. The scrawl was just that: handwriting imprecise enough to question the health of the author's hands. Kinde didn't know if it had been there when he took the television - the apartment had been dark, he could hardly see - or if someone had planted it on him on the way back. But if that were the case, what house were they talking about? He hadn't been anywhere but the deepest parts of the city, no houses... unless the house was metaphorical, but smarty-dude lingo like that was beyond someone like Kinde, so if that were the case then he decided he was doomed away. In any case, it gave him the creeps. Pawning it ASAP seemed like a solid idea. Or better yet, why not just return it? Hell, if that guy he stole the TV from was in danger, the last thing Kinde wanted was to get mixed up in it by having the goods on his hands, or have the money trail lead back to him.

Or, in any case, the message had him too on the edge to sleep. He strapped it to his back again and threw his blanket over his shoulders like a cloak, turning his tall frame into a bent figure, and left. Granny had disappeared, so he slipped back into the night without another word.

He didn't whistle this time out, didn't jaunt or smile. Something was egging at him from just outside the corner of his eyes. He didn't want to take the way he'd come, something didn't feel right about it. Maybe he was just being paranoid - the note wasn't meant for him anyway - but the whole thing just gave him the creeps: the chicken-scratch scrawl, the "I SAW YOU", the "US"... even though the last line was cliche, it didn't help.

He took a longer route, curling through alleyways and passages only blocks away from busy thoroughfares, keeping the sound of New York's busy core close like a kind of nightlight, even as the darkened buildings around him sucked out all light. He saw by feel, going off the slivers of toxic green and sickly orange light, avoiding anything his mind might try to play tricks with: garbage cans that might as well have been thugs lying in wait, strays and rodents picking their heads up at the interloper like they were taking account for some master, and-

Something dropped from a fire escape and charged into Kinde, hurling him onto his back. The TV broke his fall, and the ropes slipped off of the smashed machine. Kinde, reeling from the blow, heard three other somethings - no, someones - drop from above. One hissed and gurgled, then laughed like a man, "Not an old one like you thought, Tory. Much fresher than that, aaah."

"Still easy pickings," the one that charged composed itself and strode up, its figure wholly obscured by the backlighting of the alley's end, until it stood over Kinde. He grabbed him by the collar and hauled him up to eye level -- or would have, if at his touch Kinde hadn't run a dagger into the thing's crotch. It howled and leapt back, then crumpled. Kinde sprang to his feet and turned to face the rest of them, shouting, "Hah! Easy pickings my dick," until the one he thought he saw crumple threw an arm around his neck and squeezed until Kinde couldn't breath, taking his knife-hand and forcing it with frighteningly little effort up, towards Kinde's chest, pressing the tip against his beating heart. He didn't say anything, just hissed and groaned. Kinde thrashed and gasped, but the man had him tight.

"Police!" he heard from behind him, further down the alley, "Desist or I will use deadly force!"

One of them laughed and another dropped to all fours and rushed for the cop, but a gun went off and he heard death-howls.

"I repeat, desist or-"

Kinde's captor grunted and threw him to the ground, almost onto his own knife if he hadn't spun and drove it into his attacker's side in the fall. The thing shrieked, but it sounded more like an order than a cry, as he and the others bolted from the scene, leaping like wind out of sight.

"Holy shit!" Kinde gasped, rolling over and looking around the barren alley. The thug the cop'd shot was gone line the rest. The cop reached out a hand and helped him up, and when he stood they shared a look. Kinde saw the black-haired old dude whose house he'd just burgled, frowning the shit out of him, while Charles saw the lucky little punk who stole his TV, whose mouth seemed to rest in a smirk even now.

"Oh hey," Kinde offered, trying to worm out of Charles handgrip, "I was just about to go find you."

"I bet you were," Charles held tighter.

"I, uh - I'm Kinde, nice to meet you," he said, trying to turn the grip into a handshake.

"Charles. Pleasure."

They stood there, shaking awkwardly, as Kinde tried to avoid Charles' eyes and Charles tried to bore into Kinde with his stare.

"So, uh, about your TV..." Kinde began, trying to turn around to gesture to the broken pile of electronics behind him.

"About to go pawn it?"

"Actually, funny story!"

"Uh-huh." Their hands were still shaking.

"See, I got home, set the thing down, plugged it in, all ready to sit back and enjoy some boob-tube, when what do I find on the screen but, wouldn't you know it, a sticky note bearing a death threat!"

"Uh-huh."

"I mean, I still have it..." he fumbled with his other hand in his pocket for the note and handed it to Charles, "Gave me the creeps."

Charles warily took his eyes from Kinde to the note.

"Now, being such an inner-city slug like myself, I don't see many houses. Ever. So I assumed the note was already there when I, ah, stole your TV. I thought you might like to know about it, and, you know, there was no way in Hell I was keeping a TV that came with a death threat. At least not a death threat in handwriting like that."

Charles' grip had loosened. He hadn't looked away from the note. Kinde pulled his hand back and wiped off the clamminess on his pants.

"How do I know you weren't sent?"

"What?"

"You heard me," Charles shoved his gun under Kinde's chin, "How do I know you're not just some pawn of the guy who sent this note? How do I know you're not the one who wants me dead?"

Kinde rattled off reasons, thinking more about the gun under his chin than the words he was spewing: "Man, whoa-- if I were a pawn, why would my hypothetical boss have chosen this alleyway a mile from your apartment as the perfect location to give you the note? Why would I have stolen your TV as a means of trying to kill you? Why would I have gotten beaten up by thugs, left my knife in one of them, so that I was winded and unarmed by the time you arrived to my overwhelmingly well-picked point of ambush?"

Charles huffed and backed off. "Something's going on," he said and, when Kinde threw up his hands and declared, "I had no idea," glared at the kid hard. "Punk like you, steals my TV before I save his life from some hopped-up nightcrawlers, and all I get's grief and a death threat? I could cuff you right now. At least then I'd have something to show for this worthless night."

"You could. Or you could accept something /is/ going on, and that you can't, or at least really shouldn't ignore it. Considering what's going on, we shouldn't talk about this on the streets. I'd suggest your place, but they know you live there. I can take you to mine, but you gotta promise, nothing and nobody you see leaves your lips, compris?"

He shifted, "No, let's find a place neither of us call home. I'm uncomfortable enough just working with a thief like you."

"Glad it's mutual then. Let's go."



Kinde had bought them a night in the highest lofts of the Montag, one of the city's fanciest hotels. He'd drawn a fistful bursting with twenties from his pocket, sprinkled them on the counter before the clerk, and asked, "Will this be enough? I want something with a view. Something /fancy/."

"Crime doesn't pay, jeez," Charles had sighed as they entered the elevator to their floor.

"Well, for the most part it doesn't. I just happen to specialize in pick pocketing other pickpockets."

"And my TV?"

"I burgle for the thrill. Sorry I broke it, by the way."

The room rivalled Charles' apartment for size and beat Kinde's in every respect: wall-to-wall lavender carpets, four-poster bed with curtains, a living room lined with master paintings and statuettes of precious gems, a fireplace, a television many times the size of Charles' former one -- the place's decadence elated Kinde and deflated Charles. Five years protecting the city and sowing justice, and this upstart thief could afford a hundred times the luxury he could without even thinking about it.

"The benefit of paying in cash," Kinde advised, "Is that I'll be able to pawn all these shiny trinkets they left us and they'll never be able to trace me."

Charles shook his head.

"Complementary wine, too! This place has everything!"

"This is a waste of time. I'm a police investigator, you're some thug I should have in cuffs by now, you can't help me. Why do I even want your help? Help with what?"

"No, we went over this. Here," he handed him a glass of wine, "There is much to discuss, because I'm not willing to believe this is coincidence. Why did you come looking for me?"

"I... no, let me start from the beginning. Let's go outside."

Charles led the way onto the balcony, from which they towered over the city and beheld the cityscape. It might have been 3 AM, but New York's metrotopia churned on, nature's cycles be damned: skyscrapers stood like obelisks to the black and smog-ridden heavens, pockmarked with light from offices still laying claim to their inhabitants, while the streets below smoldered with activity. From this height, the gleam of business and traffic coalesced into streams of red and orange lights, like the fire-lakes and magma-rivers that  traversed Tartarus.

Charles sighed, and began.

"I live to defend this place, this city, from itself. Citizens steal, maim, rape, and kill each other totally unaware of everyone's debt and need for society. I used to be an anarchist, but where would we be without a government? Not anarchy, nobody could handle that chaos for long. Strongmen would rise up, tyrannize those weaker than themselves, and government would reappear in a vicious and miltaristic way. So, government is inevitable; at least ours is as merciful as it is. We depend on each other to make life better, longer, but no one realizes it. It's bizarre.

"After five years as a cop, the force knows my name. They know I'm a skilled investigator, they see how many cases I've broken, and the higher-ups want to benefit from it. They hand me down their cases, and I glimpse how nihilistic and unfeeling society is: people gone missing and found dead that we know about, but nobody wants investigated; shady links between politicians and their counterparts in the underworld that'll get you fired if you mention them; rape and theft victims that come in asking for an investigation but call it off days later because, despite all the excuses they give, we know they were being harrassed by the assailant, but the force apparently has better things to worry about -- like closing these cases without actually bringing anyone to justice. We get reasons sometimes - technicalities, lack of funding, dropped charges - but mostly we just come in the next morning and the case is shut. The more I see it and the more I wonder if the city's not trying to hide something.

"But then I get a call this morning, 'Charles, I'm coming to pick you up. Something happened in Myleton. Something... something really... really bad.' It was a fellow investigator, Samuel Burns, and fifteen minutes later he's outside my door, I get in his car, and off we go. I ask him, 'What's going on? What's 'really bad'?' but he doesn't say anything. He looks distracted, shocked, maybe even frustrated. I don't know, I didn't push the issue. Two hours later, it was about noon by then, and we pull up the dirt road to this little farmhouse. Cornfields surrounded it, other houses dotting the distance amongst the crops, and Sam takes in a deep breath. 'Alright,' he says, and gets out. I follow, still not sure what's happening, until we pass the side of the house. Then...

"Six men hung by one foot each from this apple tree behind the house. Their eyes had been forced out, so their faces were bloodied almost beyond recognition. Sam and I have seen a lot: serial killings, mutilations, street-torture gone too far, but as hard as we feel, as little as we choke with those cases, this was different. Sam jumped at the sight, and even in recomposing himself, couldn't bring his eyes up or speak for many minutes. I was just in shock: these men, hanging like upside-down puppets, their faces and arms still dripping blood even as the flies had begun to take root, each face unnaturally emotionless. And then the coup de grace: a woman no older than me, nailed to the tree's hulk. The wounds were messy; she had struggled, her face was contorted into a scream, her eyes pleading for mercy even in death. Cops milling around the scene didn't look any more. They were pale as ghosts. The EMTs didn't know what to do. They just stood around their vans, idling in distress. Should they take the bodies? The cops wanted them for evidence. They were dead, there wasn't any point, but maybe an autopsy? No one had the heart to decide yet.

"I didn't speak to the survivors, the farm's owner and only daughter. I saw them hurry by me, escorted by police into the ambulance to be taken somewhere, I don't know. I tried to ask if I could speak with them, but a cop turned me a look of dismay like I had never seen. The two civilians shivered, hunched under their blankets as they shuffled into the ambulance, like they were leaving a warzone.

"I got the transcripts of their experiences from an investigator already on the scene. I-"

"Wait, there was already an investigator there? Why did they need you?"

Charles opened his mouth to reply, but stopped. He looked up from the city below and at Kinde. He could see the gears whirring behind the boy's curious eyes. His face had grown strangely hard, replacing his natural smirk with a pensive frown.

"... I... don't know."

"I can see them wanting the extra numbers, maybe a mobile crime lab, but that's not what they called for. The town had a department large enough to host its own investigator, so why call you?... It took you two hours to get to the scene, that means you got the call at ten... when did the police become aware of the scene?"

"...Nine thirty. And the 911 call was too frantic to warrant anything more the standard brigade of police, firemen, and EMTs..."

"Yeah, now you're getting it. Something /is/ going on, Chuck."

"...but the investigator was there long before us. It takes half an hour to get from the town's core to Wesson's farm, so the cops would have arrived just as we got the call, but that's if they left right when they got the call. Small-town cops on a Wednesday morning, it would have taken them at least ten minutes to organize, at least, which means..."

Kinde nodded, "Yup. You got duped."

"Christ. I need more wine."

"I can handle that," he took their glasses and moved inside, "But let's talk about something else. Those thugs in the alley?"

"Yeah, the hopped-up-"

"Those weren't thugs. I don't know what they were. They looked human -- frighteningly androgenous, featureless, but I couldn't see much in the dark -- but I've never seen a man take a knife to the balls, and I mean up your dick to the hilt, and leap up two seconds later with the necklock of a lifetime. I've never seen a man take a bullet point-blank and disappear, no blood, no trace, seconds later. Also one of those bitches has my knife stuck in his side and I'm angry about that. Also, here, the cause of and solution to all of life's problems. Cheers!" He handed Charles more wine. They clinked glasses. "I've also never seen an investigator unload so readily on the unarmed."

"I had a fucked up day, kid-"

"I might have accepted 'self defense' as an answer, but a fucked up day doesn't cut it. Remember when you stuck your heater to my throat, asked me if I was just some pawn? I could ask you just as easily, how did you find me in that alley? Why /didn't/ you cuff me?"

"I needed to go for a walk after writing the report of the crime scene. Writing that, seeing it-- even before seeing the death threat, this case has me on the edge. It was just chance I found you, and that chance..." Kinde's accusations melted at the word 'chance', and it clicked again:

"No, quit the excuses. I don't want to ruin the illusion. I stole your TV because I was supposed to find the death threat and head back out to find you. You went for a walk because you were supposed to find me. The... things caught us so you wouldn't just arrest me outright..." Kinde's rambling melted into mumbling as his eyes drifted to the ceiling. Charles shook his head, "So I get to thank Jesus for a death threat from..."

He went a little paler as the situation dawned on him again. Kinde noticed and stopped his musing. "From a bunch of corpses. Someone's trying to fuck with our minds."

"Yeah..." Charles muttered, sinking into a chair as the day sank into him: Sam that morning, haunted, hunted by something at the edge of his awareness; the bodies like puppets, arranged so neatly, gored with such intentional madness; the men's mouths as they hung open in mid sentence, all the same word -- he could almost hear it, hear their voices from beyond death, hear... -- the look of the survivors, frightened, horrified, the luxury of shock just out of reach; the poised face of the town's investigator as he said "Here, take my notes. I can't do this. I've been here too long."; and then I SAW YOU oh god I SAW YOU AT THE HOUSE TODAY he could see their eyes, beady little LOOKING US OVER eyes like obsidian marbles, looking I SAW YOU LOOKING everywhere and nowhere in some mad stare while IF YOU WANT TO LIVE she pleaded with them, her voice frantic, crying as they pounded STOP IT pounded STOP IT pounded the nails DON'T COME

IF YOU WANT TO LIVE

He fell asleep where he sat, Kinde where he stood. Sleep was not kind.



"Charlie, where've you been? Sam was all kinds of worried about you this morning."

He swept past the front desk - "Charles? Are you alright?"- disheveled but alert, focused. He burst through the door into the den of police where he normally worked, it bustling yet like the mechanical hive it had always been.

"Charlie," Sam, "where were you? I knocked on your door, there was no answer, what-"

"Who gave you the call to go to Myleton yesterday?"

"What?"

Charles stepped closer, until Sam could smell the concern, the wrongness. "Who gave you the call?"

"I, uh- I don't know, Charlie. Are you OK? You look-"

"Go find out."

"Charlie, the case has been closed to us."

/Knew it./

"The local investigators will take care of it."

Charles put his hand on Sam's chest and balled it and the shirt into a fist, "Myleton has five hundred inhabitants, Sam. A town that size doesn't distinguish between investigators and cops, nevermind having more than one dedicated to that purpose. We're being had, Sam. Something is going on."

"Charlie, that case was bizarre. I've never seen anything like it. We'd best just-"

Charles snapped his attention to the death threat. That would convince him. He frantically searched himself for it as Sam continued, until he realized he'd left it with Kinde. He sufficed to grab Sam by the collar and recite it:

"I got a note last night, Sam. Stuck to my TV by the time I got home. I SAW YOU TODAY, it read, Sam, I SAW YOU AT THE HOUSE TODAY, LOOKING US OVER."

"What, Charlie--"

"STOP IT, DON'T COME, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE."

"Charlie, get off of me," he pushed away his hands, "You're messed up right now. Go home, get some sleep, just..." Charles caught him by the eyes, and in the look overpowered Sam with the fire, the fury, the frustration he exuded... "You got a death threat by the time you got home?"

"Yeah."

Sam looked at him for a time, deliberating. Finally, "Alright. Don't tell anyone I'm doing this for you," he motioned for Charles to follow him down the hall into his office, "but Chad and Melissa are being put under witness protection here in New York. They need an escort to their new home. The escort is supposed to be Jim Scott, but he doesn't know yet. I'll just switch the names. Here, take this. It's their file. Go pick them up from the interrogation room. They slept there overnight. Follow the directions, but..." he looked back into Charles' eyes, "Go easy on them. They've been through a lot."

Charles took the file and huffed, as if to say "You don't know the half of it," but managed to offer a strained, "thanks." And left Sam. Charles spun and disappeared into the department's din, wracked by determination, passing through the white collars like a wind, felt but not seen, until he escaped the noise and came to the interrogation room and flung it open. Chad, lying on the ground, yelped and scrambled to sit up, Melissa sleeping, shaking, on a nearby table. They looked at this figure standing in the door, cast in darkness by the light behind him.

"Let's go," it said, "We need to talk, and you need to go somewhere safe."

“What?” Chad groaned, “This is the police headquarters. This is safe.”

He walked into the room, up to Chad, “Come on. I’m investigator Charles Anderson, and let me tell you this,” he gripped his collar and they looked each other in the eyes, “This isn’t safe. Let’s go.”

He turned around and saw Melissa standing behind him, wrapped in her tattered blanket like a ghost, still shaking. He hadn’t heard her get up. Chad fumbled to his feet, and Charles took them both by the arms – Melissa’s was cold as ice – and pulled them into the hall, slipping again through the throngs, and into an elevator. He let go of them to press the button for the basement garage, as Chad took Melissa in his arms, half to still her shaking, half to still his own waking fears.

Charles thought he heard her whimper, and Chad whispered into her hair, “Shh, no, it’s alright, it’s alright…” “He should know,” she replied. “Shhh, he doesn’t-“

“Doesn’t what.” The elevator lurched downward.

“Nothing, sir, she-“

“Doesn’t. What. Chad.”

Melissa tugged at her father’s frayed sleeve, “He should know.” Chad sighed, maybe even sniffled beneath the elevator’s rumble, and said, “Alright. Investigator-“

The elevator dinged and stopped abruptly, not at the basement garage but some intermediate floor, and the doors slammed open as if forced. A figure stood ready as they opened with a shotgun, loaded, cocked, his finger on the trigger. Charles had no time to react before he opened fire, first one round, then two into the civilians. Charles, unharmed, whipped his head and watched them slump, mutilated by shot, then tore his pistol from its holster to fire on their assailant, but when he turned around all he saw was a floor of shocked bureaucrats. White-collar cops looked at him, a wall of shocked stares. Some papers fluttered to the ground; the attacker was gone. Charles blinked, his weapon pointed, shaking, into the crowd, who stared back not in fear, but in judgment, not in concern, but in analysis. His pistol clattered to the floor, and then he followed, dropping to his knees, his eyes sharing the same look of cowed confusion as his onlooking judges.



Phonecall Transcript: Charles Anderson calling “Kinde”, October 13, 2005. Mr. Anderson in custody for murder of Melissa and Chad Wesson. Number traced and team sent to investigate

“Kinde. I don’t know if you’ll get this message, or if they’ve gotten you too already, but… Those figures that attacked you the other night. I saw one today. It attacked me – no, not me, it attacked Chad and Melissa while I was escorting them to a safehouse. We didn’t even leave HQ by the time it attacked. It was so strangely timed: Melissa starts saying ‘he should know, he should know’ and her father tries shutting her up, but the moment he concedes, starts to tell me something, the elevator doors fly open, this thing stands in the doorway, and unloads two shotgun shells into Chad and Melissa. I turned my head to look at them after he fired the shots – I guess I didn’t get hit because I was just outside the gun’s cone of fire – and I look back and the thing’s gone. A whole floor of white-collar cops saw it, but they all say I shot them, say the doors opened just as I pulled the trigger on them. The bullet wounds didn’t show anything like that: they were riddled with shot, not my .45, but a floor full of witnesses saw me do it. I don’t know what’s going – No. I lived because they needed a scapegoat for eliminating the pair. They knew something, Kinde, and something else doesn’t want us knowing. This is too strange, and whatever it is, it’s got me now. Get out of the city, Kinde, get as far away from this as you can, or they’ll-“

“Dude, what? Fuck that shit.”

“Kinde!-“

“Stay put. This is so exciting.”

[End Call]



Kinde hung up the phone with a smile so wide it threatened to tear his face in two, but sobered as fists began to pound on the hotel room’s door.

“Police, open up!”

He rolled his head and groaned before throwing back a shot of rum, and shook out the burn like a lion shaking off fleas. His rasped exhale sounded like a low roar.

“Police!” they banged. His smile returned, “Open up!”

He walked to the door and breathed deep. In a single fluid motion, he bolted the door, threw his foot on the door handle and launched himself to an alcove above it, scrambling behind a clay pot there. The door burst open before he stopped moving. He watched the police file in, guns up. Blue-collars, grunts, he noted, but in Kevlar. I must be serious business. They fanned through the three-room apartment, calling to each other – “Clear.” “Clear.” “Someone was in here, they bolted the door.” “Clear. Where is he?” – as Kinde slipped from behind the pot back to the floor, slinking out the open door as they all scratched their heads. He gave himself a pat on the back as he trotted to the elevator. As he passed the clerk on the way out, Kinde shot him a smile and a wave – “Great service, thanks!” – as the clerk watched in disbelief. He passed into the streets and, remembering his missing knife, turned out his pockets – his cash was in his bag, back in the room – and chuckled. Several hours later, a lawyer named Wes O’Brien would discover that his wallet had been stolen, while several hours prior his credit card would purchase a 7” switchblade and a book of metro tickets. A homeless man by the name of James Holland, sleeping on a train to Queens, would wake up later that day and find a slim leather wallet stuck in his breast pocket and subsequently wonder, though not for long, who “Wes O’Brien” was and why he had so many pictures of feet in his wallet. Kinde would also pose a quandary of his own: why did the NYPD’s lobby have a far-too-detailed map of the building and its floors engraved on a pedestal, out for all to see?



“He didn’t know them until two days ago. I can’t imagine why he would do this…”

“Are you sure he didn’t know them?”

“I… I don’t know.”

He could hear them talking in the hall. Sam and some higher-up with a blank expression and a shiny badge, shinier than his. That’s how you knew his rank without having to check, it was fancier. He pressed questions while Charles sat cuffed in the lightless interrogation room he’d taken Melissa and Chad out of only hours prior.

“I mean, I’m pretty sure he didn’t know them. He doesn’t have many friends, you see, he’s just a distant sort of guy. We go bowling sometimes.”

“You know he didn’t have many friends?”

“Well… No, but he never… really mentioned anyone…”

“So you assume he’s a loner by his omissions?”

“I…”

No one had seen the figure except for him. Melissa and Chad had seemed to, he thought, judging by the looks of inhuman horror on their faces as they had slumped. No run-of-the-mill man with a gun could ever evoke that much fear. They knew something. They tried to tell him something. Something had stopped them and framed him for it. And now something was outside that door, solidifying it all with Sam.

“Sir,” another voice said in the hall.

“Yes?”

“No one was at the apartment, but the door was bolted when we arrived.”

“Bolted? Then how could… either you all missed him,” the officers inhaled audibly at their superior’s hissing accusation, “Or he was already gone via a crafty escape. In any case, his accomplice is still out there. I want at least three investigators on this ‘Kinde’. Sam, that’s you and two others. Go. I want him here as soon as possible.”

“Yes sir.”

Footfalls signaled the exit of all but the higher-up, who Charles saw through the window as he watched the rest leave. His face felt wrong: too lean, too sharp. He looked in at Charles; even his stare felt stabbing. Charles’ insides knotted even as he glared back. I SAW YOU rattled in his mind.

Charles’ head fell in resignation. None of this made any sense, but he could see strands, spindly hands at work here – or he was just mad. That seemed more and more likely, the more he thought about it: the death threat, maybe Kinde had made it up, and the punks in the alleyway? Still, they could have been Kinde’s friends, the whole thing could have been staged, could have been a ploy to fuck with the force, but what about Melissa and…

The door clicked unlocked and swung open. Charles didn’t look up, only seeing the police khakis and formal shoes clacking into the room, closing the door behind the entrant.

“You got yourself in deep, Charles.” The voice was deep. He didn’t recognize it. He didn’t reply. “Killed two civilians, two traumatized survivors at point blank. Unloaded on them, three clips each. Christ, that’s just gratuitous. Hey, you listening to me?” The feet sauntered closer, “I’m talking to you. Hey, shithead, look at me when I’m talking to you!” His hand grabbed Charles by the chin and forced his head up.

“Kinde?”

“Heh, yeah.”

“How?”

“If I said plot device, it would be way too telling of my life philosophies. Come on, before this uniform’s owner wakes up.”

Charles looked at him like he was from another planet. Kid, two civilians were just killed by something only I and the victims saw, you were assaulted the other night by creatures who weren’t even phased by multiple knife wounds or gun shots, all in some connection to the most bizarre suicide-homicide I’ve ever seen, and it doesn’t register to you as anything more than a game. Do you understand any of this at all?

Kinde stood by the door, “You coming?”

Charles blinked. “How're you getting us out of here?”

“Fake eyebrows, big noses, and glasses. Also knives,” Kinde replied, taking two Groucho Marx masks from his pockets.

“It makes me sad that your plans work.”

“Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say. Now shut up and get along, we've got places to go.”

“Such as?”

“Such as not here. Now, on three, we're calm policemen with striking resemblances to a dead comedian, on our way to lunch,” he said with his hand on the door, “One, two... three.”

He pushed the door out and stepped into the hall, finding himself faced with a big, unnaturally burly desk-cop facing the other way. His shirt stretched, threatened to rip across his bulk, hunching slightly beneath the ceiling. Kinde inched around him in the narrow space, but Charles paid more attention. He didn't know this man, hadn't seen a cretin that big anywhere in the building. He might be new, but what would he be doing just standing there? Keeping guard? Why would they put a desk-cop up for that?

The giant snorted, “Hmm? Who's that?” and turned halfway round to see Kinde edging past his girth. Charles looked up and saw nothing: an abyssal mist swirled and pulsed where his face should've been. The veins in his neck were tainted black with the stuff, pumping it to the rest of his body. 

“Jesus Christ!” Kinde shouted. Charles kicked the thing in the groin and, with a groan, it tipped, falling, shrinking from a giant to a lanky freckled man – Joshua, new to the force, timid and prone to stuttering, Charles knew him. And now Charles had floored him.

Charles looked at Kinde indignantly, who replied defensively, “Sorry. I don't see, y'know, goons with abysses for faces every day.”

“Doesn't matter,” he could hear commotion from elsewhere on the floor, probably coming for them, “Get out of here.”

They flew down the stairs, only hearing pursuers once they'd almost reached the garage. Kinde dared to laughed as he bounded down the flights. Charles grimaced the whole way. He could hear the voices of his co-workers calling for his arrest, radioing backup to catch them. They'd seen him murder two innocents in cold blood; he'd seen Joshua transformed by ineffable darkness. For a moment, he envied Kinde's detachment.

They burst through the door to the garage, racing to the nearest police car. Charles jammed in his key, unlocked the doors, and dove in the driver's seat. Kinde hopped in shotgun as Charles gunned the gas. Police had just begun to appear on the floor, barking orders and training their weapons on the car – weapons?!

“Holy shit, dude, they're firing at us! Hah!”

Charles slumped down in his seat to avoid the fire. Bullets tore into the vehicle and slammed into the windows. “I'm a cop, goddamnit! This is not supposed to happen!” He swerved around a corner, still underground, out of their lines of sight, only to find himself staring down another line of officers blocking the garage exit, people he'd known for years, gone bowling with, met their spouses – people firing guns meant to kill him.

Charles took his foot off the gas to put it on the brake, to not kill his friends, to turn himself in for whatever he'd done, but Kinde slammed his foot over Charles', keeping it on the gas.

“This isn't the time for repentance. There's nothing to repent for. Whatever they're firing at, Charles, it's not you. They're firing under orders, for their duties. Whatever was stuck on that kid's face, whatever we met in that alley – whatever shot Chad and Melissa, it's more importa- HOLY SHIT!”

Thirty yards from the line of officers and all faces turned white. They dropped their guns, froze like deer in headlights. Some wept, some urinated, still others gripped enough wit to run for their lives. Their shadows turned to worms at their feet, nightmarish and transparent tubules wriggling at an otherworldly pace into a single being, rising up from the concrete into an ineffable ghast. Its maw dripped terror, its numberless claws snapped at those that fled. It reared back, its form-beyond-knowing bending at angles that wrenched the mind, and roared with the death-screams of a thousand torn asunder, just as Charles' car burst from the garage, through its midsection and into the police that still stood before it, frightened into paralysis and now hurled into traffic. In panic they swerved into an oncoming truck, imploding the driver's side of the car. In the instant before he blacked out, Charles looked up from the chaos of the car to where the beast had risen and saw it look at him without eyes and whisper:

I SAW YOU



“He's waking, looks like. Answers your question.”

“Hmm. 'Spose it does. Lucky him. That liver would've fetched a good price, too.”

Charles' eyes opened, taking a moment to focus. The three of them were in a small room, what might have once been a meat locker from the looks of it. Medical machinery, old and grimey, pocked the room. He brought his hand up to his face and mumbled, “What... ungh...” before slumping again.

“How long'll he be out, doc?”

“Forever unless you front more.”

The rustle of dollar bills changing hands, “Dick. Honor among thieves my ass.”

“Hey, my wife's anniversary's coming up, what'm I s'posa do?”

Kinde grunted. “Fix my friend, that's what.”

“Friend!” Charles coughed his way into a chuckle, “When all this is over, I'm cuffing your ass.”

“You don't cuff corpses, Charlie. We're in deep.”

Charles opened his eyes again and focused them on Kinde, “What?”

“Did you see that thing? Those things?”

“What things?” a bald man in a bloody doctor's smock asked. He had just finished pocketing Kinde's money. Kinde glared at him.

“I am a child of the underworld, Charlie. The things I have seen, the people I have known – do you know what Kelly here's done in cold blood for another day's cash?”

“Hey, it's doctor bloodsmith, alright?”

“Fuck you. I've seen you come upon tourists lost in New York, find themselves in alleys just to get your 'tools' in their guts. You gag them so they can't scream while you dissect them, Kelly, so they'll be freshest for the market. You only help me because you know I'll kill you in an instant, because you see that in my eyes. What I saw today I cannot explain by any stretch of the imagination. We're lucky to be alive, but that damned thing popped up out of nowhere, froze the po-po in their tracks, sowed enough confusion in five seconds to lay out five bodies. Near to six, shape you looked in. Be thankful doctor bloodsmith here he knows both how to take bodies apart and put them back together.”

“H-hey now, I don't appreciate this kind of... of slander, Kinde!”

“Yeah?” Kinde crossed around the stretcher, his knife flashing in his hand, “And I don't appreciate the kind of mindless atrocities scum like you perpetuates. I don't appreciate,” he forced Kelly against the wall, pressing the knife against his throat, “the way you don't even feel what you do. Life isn't just some game, doctor.”

Kelly screamed and dropped the scalpel he'd picked up as Kinde slashed his wrist. Charlie sat up. “Kinde what are you doing?”

Kinde huffed with his knife at Kelly's throat again. Kelly was crying, “my arm... my arm, god, what'd you do...”

“Kinde-” “Fine. Leave this maggot.” He rammed his knee into Kelly's stomach and struck him across the cheek, tossing him to the floor before returning to the stretcher, “You alright? Can you walk?”

Charles tried not to look at the writhing, sobbing creature on the floor, “Yeah, uh... just give me a hand... How do I look?”

“Bad.”

“Heh. Hrm.”

Kinde shuffled Charles out of the meat locker and closed the steel door behind them.

“Should I call the cops? They'd get him a stretcher. I messed up his wrist pretty bad, I don't think he'll live if he doesn't get help.”

Charles sighed and winced at the pain tearing his body, “We've killed, what, five people today? Plus Chad and Melissa makes seven. Mary and the farmhands makes thirteen. Thirteen's bad luck, you know.” He coughed hard and spat blood. “Let's make it fourteen.”

Kinde didn't laugh.



They were in the police cruiser again. Kinde drove while Charles nursed his wounds, winking in and out of sleep. He was scarred badly across his face, his left arm was in a cast. It hurt to breathe.

“Where are we going?” he wheezed.

“Where else? The house.”

He wanted to ask why, but his lungs burned too much.

“I don't know where else to go. I know we're in this for a reason, but... but that's all I know.”

Charles exhaled heavily. The metrotopian bridges and skyscrapers of New York City faded as they drove out, shifting into country green muted by gray skies and rain. Trees blurred in their passing; hitchhikers looked ghastly, misshapen through the rain.

It had been two days since they first met. They didn't know each other then; they didn't know each other now. The lean and wind-swept twenty-something driving the car had twice saved him, but that was all he knew about him. He stole things. He was talented. He believed in purpose to a fault. These seemed like trivial things, but they formed the framework for the absurd logic that Kinde exuded in his recklessness, the strangely sensible madness and wholly human failings that pocked every man's heart. Maybe he knew him better than he thought.

But they weren't here to get to know each other. Charles felt pressed against this man. Under any other circumstance, Kinde would be behind bars. But now he was Charles' only link to survival. He'd be incarcerated without him, or dead like... like the other officers. Christ, five bodies. Five families in grief. Five futures snuffed. When he recalled the look he got at the ineffable thing the instant before all hell broke loose and five dutiful servants to society were ended, nothing came to mind. The scene in his mind was empty: men and women firing at him one instant, white-faced the next, flying over the car the third, and in the fourth I SAW YOU.

Charles shivered.

But that's not how it happened. He had seen something. Kinde had seen something. The officers had seen something. It would be on the news, right? What wasn't on the news nowadays?

“No,”  Kinde blurted, “Of course I'm not alright.”

“What?”

“Today sucked.”

“Were we in the middle of a conversation? Did I nod off?”

Kinde harumphed. 

Charles coughed and groaned. He was having second thoughts about seeing the house in this condition.

“I hate killing,” Kinde continued.

“Really?”

“I steal things, I'm not a murderer. Sure, I've dropped a man when I needed to, when it was either him or me, you know how that is. But it still ruined my day. I steal things. Things can be replaced, but people can't. I hate killing.”

“How noble.”

“What, like you don't cringe when you pull the trigger? The way you fired on those things in the alley, I know you've done it before, and not just on targets. A real first killer would've missed. You didn't even blink.”

Charles cleared his throat, “I'm not going to talk about this.”

“Oh-ho! So-”

“No.”

Kinde shut up. After a moment, “Not to pry. Just down is all.”

“I understand.”

“Thanks.”



“Chuck, wake up.”

“What?”

“It's too late to go to the house.” Charles glanced at the car's clock, but couldn't see its weak glow in the dark, which he assumed was due to the moonless night.

“Yeah. No way in hell am I going there without the sun to back me up.” His voice felt better. His scars hurt, and his arm ached, but breathing was no longer a trial. The car was parked outside a shabby motel, the “Myleton Motor Inn”. The sun had just finished setting, and now cast only the slightest hints of light over the horizon, so that the inn's exterior caught only a single streetlight's warmth, casting it with long shadows. Cracks in the paint looked like veins in the walls.

“I already paid for a room. Didn't want to wake you.”

Charles opened the car door with his good hand and stepped out, “Sleeping like a baby, I bet.”

“More like a rhinoceros. I was afraid you'd horn me.”

“You mean impale you on my rhinoceros horn?”

“What?” Kinde unlocked their first-floor room, “That's gross.”

Charles smiled. The lights flickered on and they entered. Time had washed out what were probably once welcoming, earthy tones. The Indian-esque patterns woven into the carpet seemed jagged, and the one queen-sized bed seemed at once to have both people-sized indentations and people-sized lumps in it. The light, as outside, was inadequate, the room's two lamps casting only a weak glow over the room. Shadows faded, but did not disappear.

“Weak boy takes the bed,” Kinde motioned, “I'll take the floor.”

“Weak boy,” Charles chuckled, the beginnings of puzzlement forming in his mind at Kinde's sustained kindness, “I must be twenty years your senior. How old are you?”

“Twenty-three,” he replied, fumbling with the television's broken dials.

“Heh, I'm forty-eight. Boy indeed.”

“You look it, too,” Kinde shouted after Charles entering the bathroom, “All the lines and creases on your face – you've seen a lot, man. It's in your skin.”

Charles closed the bathroom door behind him and turned on the bathroom's tap. The plumbing groaned and coughed, sputtering brown sludge until it grew more accustomed to this stranger and acquiesced to give him clear water. He splashed it over his face and rose to examine his scars in the mirror. They weren't terrible: a long one on the left side of his face, from jawline to temple, mostly just nasty cuts Kelly had sown up with a stitch or—

She was in the door. 

Mary was there, looking at him. She — no, not her, just... — she was etched into the door, eyes wide open as if pleading. Please, he heard. Please.

He spun to face her directly and saaaaAAUGH! He heard her screaming, saw her locked in the wood in her last moment. He saw the tree behind her, its bark stained with blood, the nails in her shoulders, her face wrenched into agony, wrenching his stomach into... and beside her, one of the assailants still hammering, his fist clasped around the devil's tool, moving up and down, struggling to maintain the mental control to strike her, strike her, strike her. She was still screaming, crying in the gasps. Her attacker's eyes had already been gouged out: his hands whipped blood with every stroke and poured over his face, awe-struck at some presence just out of sight. Charles couldn't see it, but the madman knew it was there. His accomplices could see it, holding Mary's limbs against the tree, their blood bathing the scene. One dared to laugh amongst the screams.

And there it was, just over Mary's shoulder in the distance, eclipsing the dawning sun, a knot in the door's wood, swirling inward and wrapping amongst itself, thrusting out so darkly, so wrongly. But it was just a knot, just – her screams, their blood, the DON'T COME.

He blinked and it was gone. Nothing on the door. Some cracks and lines, but nothing... nothing like...

Kinde knocked on the door, “You decent? I need to maintain hygiene.”

Charles reached slowly for the doorknob. The knot was still there. Still wrong. He gripped the handle and swung the door open, to see Kinde standing in the doorway, toothbrush in hand.

Kinde's previously serendipitous expression turned serious, “You alright?”

Charles sighed, hard, and realized how fast his heart was pounding. “I need to lie down.

“That's the least of it, man. Your eyes are bleeding.”

Charles raised his hand to his eyes and touched something wet. Sure enough, looking at his fingers, he'd been crying blood.

“Kinde, we're in deep. Mary was in the door. Screaming. There's a knot still there that I won't look at again for the life of me. They don't want us at the house.”

Kinde looked at the knot in the door and shrugged, “Of course they don't, but they're dead, what do they know? Obviously not enough not to die. Therefore,” he said, smiling, “I reason our decision to go must be more intelligent than their admonishments.

“But if it helps any,” he turned towards the sink, “I'll leave the lights on tonight. Oh, and here,” he tossed Charles a box of tissues, “For the crybaby.”

Kinde disappeared into the bathroom. Charles, in a daze, picked up the tissues and dabbed his eyes. Water.

He could still hear her.



Montag didn't like this place. The shabby motel - "Myleton Motor Inn" - he didn't like it at all. Even at dusk, it evaded the sun's fading rays, catching the sparse light of just a single street lamp, casting the two-story building in long shadows. The windows looked like eyes.

He hadn't wanted to come here either. But when your wife kicks you out - "forever" she said - while you're on vacation together in the country, where do you go? If he were in a city rather than this po-dunk village, he might be resting peacefully in a Sheraton or Hilton or other million-story-pillar-of-sweet-sweet-decadence. He was lucky this no-place had a motel at all. Probably constructed solely for the use of prostitutes, he speculated. The lack of any real furnishings only solidified his position. Aside from a hard armchair whose wooden innards were concealed beneath the most pathetic layer of padding, the room featured a television without channels, a bed with inexplicable and disconcerting stains, and two lamps whose weak glow did little to dispel the room's myriad shadows, only forcing them to recede like predators hiding just out of sight.

By two AM, after trying his wife's phone forty-three times and giving up on the television, did he acquiesce to turning off the lamps and slipping into bed. He'd stripped it of its sheets to prevent himself from catching whatever terrible diseases the stains must have held and now lay, half-naked, on the slippery polyester mattress.

The fabric felt strange, cool and frictionless against his skin, like a surface of water with such unnatural tension that it would not break before his weight, while he struggled with the likewise-constructed blankets that refused him any kind of grip. They slid away from him repeatedly, such that keeping the blanket on himself was a task too intense for the sleep-bound. Thus did he remain conscious.

Until eventually the blanket did get away. He sat up and chased it with his hands, but it fell off the bed and to the floor. "Aww, shit," he murmured in the dark. He stayed sitting up, his eyes staring into space while his body tried to decide if lying back down was really worth the trouble.

Around him the room lay in near-darkness. Slivers of neon light from the motel's road sign dissolved over the room's washed out features, dripping weird pinks and oranges over the room's dead colors - except in one corner.

A beam of light ran across one intersection of wall and ceiling, but the area remained dark. It caught his attention in a way that he couldn't ignore, this slip of darkness peering out from the high nook. He blinked, and by golly it seemed bigger. The electric green splattered across the area was receding before this expanding shadow, an area - an entity hauling itself from beyond the room... beyond...

It wasn't real. It wasn't crawling into the room. It wasn't looking at him, it wasn't coming for him, goddamnit Montag, it's not real. He threw himself back into bed, forgoing the blanket for the security of his arms wrapped tightly around himself. He couldn't hear the walls bending to let more of it in, he told himself. He couldn't see it growing beady red eyes just out of the corner of his vision, he told himself. He told himself he couldn't hear its drool hitting the floor.

"Montag." He didn't hear that. "Montag." He wasn't hearing that either, the weirdly phantasmic voice warping his name, like the sounds had been filtered too many times. But of course he wasn't hearing it. There was nothing to hear. What was he talking about? "Montag."

"What?!" He shot up in bed and looked at- at his wife. There she was, short black hair, grey eyes, little lips that naturally found themselves in a smile... there she was. "Oh god, Cherry, you scared me."

"Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry for saying what I said. I didn't mean it, you know I love you. I just... we just need to talk, honey, but... but right now I need to tell you," she climbed up to him and planted her lips furtively on his, releasing only after dazing him with the kiss, "I need to tell you how sorry I am..."

"How sorry are you, honey?" He asked as she climbed on top of him.

"Oh, god, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry," she was unbuttoning his shirt, "I'm going to do all the things you've always wanted me to. Your wish," she kissed his chest, "Is my command."

"Oh god, Cherry," he groaned, "We should fight more often."

"Hmhmm," she laughed, kissing her way up his chest before landing her lips on his again for a wanting peck. "But you said I scared you?"

"Oh god yeah, honey. How did you get in? I was terrified!"

"Oh, mmm..." she bit his ear and whispered, "Good."

"What?"

She reared back, the infinite darkness he'd seen force out the light replacing her head, expanding, shedding her skin in favor of its otherworldly wrongness. Screams accompanied the abyssal emergence, both from the entity as it roared in from whatever terrible beyond spawned it and from Montag as his every sensation turned to pure and unspeakable horror.

But the misty darkness did not content itself there. It drew back and threw itself upon him, forcing itself in his eyes, through his ears, up his nose, in his mouth, as he felt it penetrate his mind, forcing his consciousness deeper and deeper into the primordial recesses, and the fear he had dared just call pure became a lowly speck before the ineffable doom that enveloped his soul now, for this thing would not kill him, that became clear as it settled over dominion of his mind. It would enslave him, shackle him to his nightmares. He could already feel it, his body dead by all accounts, but locked away in the most untouchable places of the human psyche where he would yet reside, chained and imprisoned. For all eternity, the thing warned, would he cry out for the release of his mortal coil. And for all eternity would he be denied.

One solitary cry escaped his dying lips, and then he lived no more.



Kinde woke up slowly. He looked over at the clock as the first few rays of day slipped in under the curtains. His back ached from sleeping on the floor, but he stretched and yawned like a contented feline. Only nine AM, he thought, and rolled over again with a very pleased groan. As the room grew silent again, he could hear Charles snoring softly, like the rumble of a small motor.

But as his eyes began to shut again, something hit the door. It wasn't a knock, not soft or controlled like a knock. It was like a bird murdering itself on the wood. He crawled up to his feet and approached the door as another thud rocked. Pressing his eye against the peephole, he saw only a twisted vision of the world outside, bent through shades of red. Blood. Whatever was outside hit the door again; the aged hinges began to crack.

“What the hell?” Charles groaned and began to stir, not rising or even opening his eyes.

Kinde opened the curtain and peered outside. “Chuck you might want to see this.”

“What?”

“We have a visitor.”

Outside the door stood a torn and broken man, his flesh pale and dirty. His muscles relaxed at all wrong angles, his head lolling to either side as he moved. He struggled to keep his head upright enough to keep looking at them.

“He fell from the second floor.”

“What?”

“Look at the broken wood behind him. That's the banister. It'd explain why his leg is snapped.” Kinde paused, “It'd also explain why we only heard him knocking recently. He's been spending all morning – probably all night, too – just trying to stand up.”

“Jesus.”

“Did you see him in the bathroom door last night?”

“No. Never seen him before in my life.”

He lurched at the door again, smashing his head into it. The crash gained an ugly tone once they knew what was causing it: his face slamming with all his freakish might into the door. He drew back, a part of his forehead bleeding badly from hitting the peephole. A tooth fell out of his mouth. The hinges complained with more urgency now, threatening to quit.

Kinde stepped back, “I say we beat him to it.”

“What?”

“He wants to break the door in on us? I say we break the door in on him.”

“Jesus, Kinde, we don't even know what he is. Falls from the second floor, spends all night getting up, and then breaks his face trying to get inside.”

“Well, we know a few things.” Thud. “He's got two legs. Two arms. A torso, two eyes. A nose, even if it is broken. Some teeth. No fur. I mean, he looks human to me. And to the best of my knowledge, humans don't like getting crushed by doors. Or getting shot. Or stabbed.”

Thud. He smiled, “Now, on three...”

Charles strapped on his holster, “He might just be disabled.”

“One. I see that, dude. His leg is broken. He should be in a wheelchair.”

“No, as in disturbed.”

“Two,” Thud. The wood around the door began to splinter. “I didn't say kill him. I just meant crush him. I mean, you had Kelly the Bloodsmith go at your guts and you're still here, Scarface. All we're gonna do is throw a door at him.”

Charles took up position behind Kinde, not really knowing what he was doing there, “With weapons drawn?”

“Hey, you were the one afraid he wasn't human, not me.”

Charles opened his mouth to reply as Kinde shouted, “Three!” and rammed the door. It flew off its hinges, braced against Kinde like a mobile wall, and slammed into the broken man's incoming head. The crack sickened Charles, but Kinde kept on pushing, throwing the door and the man below it to the ground. Charles followed out of the room, hand on his holster, when something gurgled and wheezed beside him. His head snapped towards its source and beheld a bloated thing, what might have been a man in days prior but from whom had vacated any essence of humanity. Its skin bore innumerable worts and boils, some popping before his eyes, while his eyes weeped pus and vomit soaked his front. Before it had a chance to waddle any further, Charles slammed it against the motel's wall.

“Holy shit, dude, that's the clerk!”

“I am a police investigator for the United States government, and you will explain yourself and this situation or I will take action to beat it out of you!”

“Whoa,” Kinde stepped on the door to keep the broken man down, “That's something you don't hear on Cops.”

Wheee werr the onesz, it gurgled, more vomit leaking from the edges of its mouth. The voice came out wrong, not from his throat – it was too deep for a creature like this, too warped, too long. Wheee killd them.

“Who? Melissa and Chad?” Charles bellowed. The thing's lips curled into a smile. Yooo knooo.

Kinde didn't see what happened next. In the span of one blink, Charles stepped back, pressed his gun to the clerk's forehead, and pulled the trigger. Kinde heard the bang. Kinde saw the brains. Kinde saw it slump. Vomit began to drain from the hole where its head had been, as if gravity had been the only thing keeping it in.

He'd seen cold-blooded murders before. But this wasn't cold. There was no calculation, no thought. It was a trigger, and the thing had pulled it. Charles had been preparing for this moment too long to remember. Not with a wretched abomination like whatever the clerk had become – Kinde had seen him last night, and last night he was human – but it didn't matter to him if it'd been Christ himself. He'd have pulled the trigger all the same.

Charles dropped his gun.

“Charles...” Kinde began, but the thing beneath his foot began to lurch again. He stomped on the door, eliciting a groan from the creature, before using his foot to push the door down past its face.

“Who are you?”

“godpleasehelpmeyou'vegottohelpme,” words flew from its broken jaw, “there'ssomethinginsideme, ohjesusit'sinsideme, ohplease, pleasegodhelpme.”

“Chuck?”

No answer. Charles still stood over his victim, not moving. Understandable.

“No dice, friend. Best you make peace with whatever it is and tell us who you are.”

The man whined and shook his head, gritting his teeth. He whipped blood from the many scrapes, dents, and cracks in his face.

“Man, Kelly would love this guy. Such tenacity.”

“Maybe they'll see each other in Hell.”

Kinde wasn't sure how to reply. “That doesn't sound very Charles-y.”

Charles glared at the boy. “Yeah. I guess it doesn't.”

Gasping and struggling, the broken man wrestled one of his arms out from under the door and grabbed Charles by the ankle, “godsirplease, idon'tknowwhattodo, comecloserandchristi'llletyouseeit, nnngh, nnghgod, pleeeeasegodsir-”

“Get off of me,” Charles' voice shrugged the words as he whipped his foot from the thing's grasp and stomped on its wrist, eliciting a scream. Grimacing, he drove his boot into the side of its skull, knocking it unconscious with a wet crack. “Let's go.”

As the driver's door slammed shut, Kinde stood at the passenger's side and looked around, really... looked. A deep fog had come to sit over the motel. It pressed into the walls and obscured even the closest objects. The clerk's office, whose door had fallen away a mere thirty feet from them, appeared miles distant. The monstrous clerk himself, mutilated and awful, seemed to shift beneath the heavy mist. The broken man, on the other hand, remained still as death. The banister on the second floor was shattered. Doors were wrenched off more than one apartment, and letters from the motel's neon sign had been pried out and lay shattered at the post's base. He could not locate the sun above them.

“Coming?” Charles had his eyes set straight ahead, staring into the area of fog behind which he assumed was the highway.

“Yeah,” Kinde got in the passenger's seat. “Yeah.”

Looking at Charles as Charles stared ahead and began to drive, Kinde felt a new sensation boil up from recesses unknown. In two days, they'd both killed a man with a fury they didn't remember or didn't realize they had, both seen things they didn't think comprehensible, didn't think possible, and now they were heading to the apparent source of it all: the murders, the shadows, the nightmares, the don't come.

Kinde felt fear.
