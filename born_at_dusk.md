title: Born at Dusk

My name is Feralice. My mom named me so because Alice was a name from before the world ended, but everything is so feral now, she called me Feralice. She thinks it's clever, but it doesn't make her smile.

She says the world used to be a bright and vibrant place, with so many people you could never meet them all, so many treats that people got so fat they couldn't walk, and so many presents people didn't have time to say thank you.

We don't live in the cities, but I've been to them. They're wonderlands, with towers that pierce the clouds and sparkle in the daylight, and pictures of people and their toys plastered on the walls -- it's like walking through a picture book. Mom says the insides of the towers used to be warm and bustling places, with people going in and out, and all kinds of treasures to be had.

Now they're just dark and dusty. The only treasure I found in a tower was a deer who got trapped behind its revolving door. I'd have killed it there for supper, but we already had rations and the corpse would've just been extra weight, so I let it out. It pranced and skittered off into the jungled maze of rock and glass. It wasn't afraid of me; I don't think it'd seen people before.

Mom says there used to be billions of people. I can't even imagine that many. I count to ten on my fingers, and think about how many people that would be, and how much space they'd take up, and how much food, and how much water, and how much they'd poop, and I just don’t know how you could fit a billion anywhere. I think Mom is exaggerating sometimes.

Mom says the world started to end when the corn got sick. We don't grow corn, so I can't imagine it was that important. But she says everything depended on corn: all the food, all the toys, all the tools, everything. So when it got sick, everything got crazy.

She says everybody freaked out and started killing each other, but then the pigs got sick too (we don't grow those either) and then people started getting it (I guess we grow those, if I'm here) and then my dad got it and now he's gone.

But Mom didn't get it, and I didn't get it, so we're still here. And there's other people who visit sometimes and trade with us, so they didn't get it either.

Mom and I go to the city sometimes and collect things for the traders, and sometimes one of them stays with us for a few days named James, who’s a grown-up like mom,  and Pheonix, who's a few years older than me.

Pheonix and I go hunting when James and Mom want to be alone, or we play explorer if we've already got enough food. We imagine we're finding the world all over again.

If it ended, like mom says it has, then where are we? If the world is over, why are we still here? Pheonix says it ended, but then it started again. It's all "begun anew.”

He likes to climb up on boulders and say, "All of this used to belong to somebody, but now it's nobody's. Now it's just there for the taking. We can make this world ours, Feralice."

I like the way his hair blows in the wind and the way he smirks when he says things like that.

Mom gets sad and cries sometimes, and she doesn't smile much even when there’s lots to smile about. She misses things like rice cookers and television and the internet, but I don't know what any of that is so I have a hard time missing it.

I like how apples taste, and I like catching fish, and I like wearing things I helped skin, and my life is full of those things.

Mom says I like Pheonix too but I think that's gross.

Pheonix says he's glad the world ended, since the world is empty now. There's hundreds of miles for us explorers now. There's apples for us. There's deer and fish. There's glass towers and streets like picture books. When we're rushing through the city's musty darkness, hand-in-hand, head-first into the unknown, laughing and screaming all the way...

I think I'm glad too.
