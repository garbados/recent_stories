title: Names

A girl took my portrait on the bus today. I couldn't fathom how she managed to draw, but her pencil scratched over her little canvas, and by all indication she seemed pleased with her creation as she lifted it into life, stroke by stroke. She hadn't asked, but I was too flattered to be bothered. We shared glances as she measured me onto her canvas, but they were awkward, accidental things. She would look, I would see, and she'd pretend to look out the window behind me. I would measure her the same, she would catch me, and I'd do my best to fake looking at the ceiling. It was an odd little rapport.

"...told her to leave him alone, y'know? Like, get off my turf, lady. Boy's mine. You know?" Another woman, large and ragged like a punk matron, and her even more giant male companion sat beside me. I shifted to make room for them on the bench, and canvas-girl's expression soured. She began erasing and furiously re-sketching. She looked up to gauge the altered  scene and met my eyes. I shrugged shoulders before my courage evaporated and I pretended to be cracking my neck.

"Bitch. I mean, it's like, he left you already, woman. He's mine now. Just go. You know?" Companion said nothing, but I suspect he nodded. Canvas-girl shook her head again and chuckled. I smiled for her.

She was pretty. Slim face, black hair -- I'd see her deep green eyes eventually, when we weren't doing our best to pretend-ignore the other. I thought about saying something, but my ex kept getting in the way of it. I'd get a sentence, maybe half a question, before it became "I wonder if she kisses like Claire did." We'd broken up... three weeks ago, I think. It was calm and quiet when it happened,  full of silences and heavy looks, kisses I couldn't handle and embraces I never wanted to leave.

"And my man, my man, is thinking about her! God. Well, I mean, they had something intense. That shit doesn't die easy." Listening, my blank smile faded to something bleak and far away. "I had a boyfriend like that once. Real fucking intense relationship, like, love and shit. But then, you know, he goes off to college, and I don't, and I don't understand college, and he doesn't understand life outside it. So we split." She paused. I look over to see her hand over her eyes, head shaking. "God that was a hard time." Her giant put one hand on her back and just steadied her with it. His eyes spoke sympathy, the kind language doesn't have words for. I looked at my feet and felt with her.

"I just went through a breakup like that." I spoke up. "It's hard. Really hard." She looked over at me, her face stern, holding herself together, and she nodded. I must have looked similar because her giant gave me those sympathetic eyes. Even canvas-girl put down her pencil. "It just... it shakes you. Like you've never been shaken before. Rocks a hole through you, and even once you come to terms with why the hole is there... it's still a hole. And it hurts. Like a part of you is gone, even when you still call her, or him in your case I guess, and when you say you'll stay friends, and you still laugh, and make jokes, and get along so well, and you think to yourself,  'what's changed other than...'"

My eyes fell to canvas-girl's shoes. I was tired of staring at my own. My thoughts had dropped off in some weak attempt to block myself from uttering the painful things drowning my heart. The punk matron picked up for me:

"...other than that you don't say 'I love you' anymore."

 "Yeah." I said and put my hand over my eyes. "Yeah."

A camera snapped. I looked up and saw canvas-girl with one steadied in her hands. "I, uh... well, I knew you wouldn't keep that pose. So I'm keeping it in here." 

"Heh." I chuckled, my hand falling away and a smile returning, revived, to my face. 

She smiled. "Glad to help." She smiled. 

I reached out my hand. "I'm--"

"No, no names." She waved my hand away. "I like you better without it."

I looked over at punk matron and punk giant and laughed as they both "ooooh!"'d at the statement. Canvas-girl smirked at me before the train began to slow and she stood up.

"But it's good to meet you." She reached out her hand and we shook. Deep green eyes brought out her fair skin. Glasses tamed the aggression and drive in her looks. She pressed something into my hand and left the train.

It was her phone number.

"Ooooh man, what a girl, hahaha!" Matron laughed. Giant added "Nice." I got off at the next stop, but I could still hear matron howling, "No, no names! Ahahaha!"

I didn't feel the hole so much then. I thought about calling Claire, telling her the good news, but... why? The worst part about this, I had discovered, wasn't that I wasn't getting laid, or that suddenly my facebook read "Single", but that my best friend was gone. I couldn't call her and share stories like this. It would have been too political; in my heart of hearts, I knew, I'd only be calling to make her jealous. To get her back.

I put the number in my pocket. My smile faded to a grimace.
