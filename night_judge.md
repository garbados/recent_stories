# Night Judge

Sometimes you see her. You know she is not there.

She is a willowy thing, draped in black rags. Darkness covers her limbs and face, hanging off her like shreds of the shadows themselves. She is only a figment of your frightened imagination. You shouldn’t have read that horror story about the child locked in his room, too scared to scream, too frightened to do anything but shiver.

In the darkness, your eyes play tricks on you. Shapes waver in and out of existence, and in a way the absence of illumination, the silence and stillness, brings the emptiness to life. You see strange things cross your eyelids, but you shake your head and they move with you. They’re burn spots on your eyes, where the retina have grown tired of the day. But she remains still, standing at the corner of your room, head downcast. You can almost see her rags shift with her breathing. You know she is not there. She must be a pocket of shadows, where what little light that trickles through the windows seems to enhance the darkness.

Maybe it is the very attempt to not see her that makes her more real. If you didn’t consider what she might or might not be, would she disappear? Being that she isn’t real, you suppose it’s a moot point, but it’s enough to get you to close your eyes at long last and try to sleep.

You feel like you've seen her before. Something woke you up you don’t know how many hours later -- probably your own dreams. She moved a few feet closer as the moonlight receded while you slept. You pick your brain for memories, and there she is. Frightened young you, curled up under the covers, doing his best to not see her in the darkness. Frustrated adolescent you, tossing and turning and doing your best to ignore her. And now ambivalent adult you, rationalizing her as you stare. You can almost feel her staring back. You know she isn’t there.

You don’t know who she is. You don’t know what she’s capable of. But she’s been here so long, she must have a reason. If she were real. What does she know about you? Why is she here? You wrack your memories for more clues, and are startled by sudden images of her just out of sight whenever I’m alone, pointing and glaring in judgment. You shiver.

Your eyes snap open after you don’t know how long. The light has shifted in the room, indicating the passage of time -- and so has she, another few feet closer. That would make the idea of a pocket of shadows make sense: the light shifted, and so did the pocket. You can’t see her there. She’s not --

A single moonbeam catches her finger as it rises. Her head stays downcast, but you can feel her eyes on you as they exude hate. The light sifts through her rags and infects what little light you have with shadows that shift and quiver. Her arm rises with her head, until you fall under her otherworldly attentions. Her eyes, however hidden, exude malice as they burn holes in your mind. Her finger holds in your direction, unwavering in its judgment. Most of her remains just out of sight, while the shadows cast by her tattered dressings grow and dissolve the light far beyond her shape, until you are left alone in total darkness with her, silent and unmoving. The emptiness truly has come alive: the shapes you once attributed to burn spots now dance and leap across the walls, while the least sound of their scraping and hissing screams in your mind. She does not move, even as the room fills with other monsters. You huddle in the blanket, too scared to scream, too frightened to do anything but shiver. Who are you? You want to shout. What do you want? What have you done? But all you can do is shiver and quake. You don’t know what she knows, but you know what you yourself have done. You know all the crimes, all the sins, she might be here to collect on. Any one of them might be enough to submit you to something far worse than a mere end, for reasons utterly beyond your mortal comprehension. You see her there now, her judgment radiant with despise as her million minions hiss and squeal with lust for justice upon your ugly soul. Beneath her crushing glare, you sob.

You awake in the morning still clutching the blankets. Sunlight has washed over the room, revealing her absence. In her place there are your dirty clothes, your computer, your dresser, your books. Mundane objects.

You sit up and sigh heavily. She’s gone. Was she ever here to begin with? Could you have been dreaming? You must have been dreaming. She was too tall to be any mistaken for any of the furniture. But then you see it.

Where she had stood on the carpet: two solid impressions of human feet. With daylight at your back, you muster the courage to scream.
