# The Secret Life of Accountants

Welcome, Initiate.

I am sure you have heard of the eight principles of the GAAP, or the mortal names for the tools of our trade -- the direct write-off method, the LCM inventory procedure, or the double-declining balance method -- but can you feel their power, initiate? Do you sense their elegance?

Surely you have seen in your ledgers the beauty of the work we do. Men, companies, even nations whole rise to power by our skill, and return to dust at our whim. They tremble when we shake, and holler ecstasy when we smile. Our manipulations, our representations, our interpretations -- our seductive facades, our lies and trickery, or deadlier yet, our truths -- send ripples across this world. You can feel it when you work on your accounts, initiate. Your fingers quiver over pen and key at the very thought. You see it in the news when the more foolhardy of our ranks make paupers out of kings. You know it in your heart when countries grow rich and prosperous. But you dare not think of the ramifications, if what you suspect were really true. You dare not stare this dragon in the eye, for in his gaze you would see all too much.

But it is true, initiate. Those are more than numbers in your ledgers. The stuff of our trade is more than finances, more than taxes, more than budgets. We audit more than businesses.

What I am about to show you will change you forever, initiate. There is no shutting your eyes once they have been opened. But you knew that the moment you stepped into my office, didnâ€™t you? I can see it in on your face. Beneath that absent expression and faraway gaze, you have always known. This is good.

There is much to do. So, so much to do.
