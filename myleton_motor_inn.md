title: Myleton Motor Inn

Montag didn't like this place. The shabby motel, “The Myleton Motor Inn” - he didn't like it at all. But Cherry had loved the strange little inn. A mile from the highway, surrounded by forest, itself a strange, dilapidated thing as if plucked from the inner-city. Montag figured it was probably constructed solely for prostitutes. He didn't like the one car sitting in the lot, the room in front of it full of flickering lights like figures darting back and forth. He didn't like how the car's driver was sitting so still.

It was a dump. Montag didn't want to be here, but... he didn't know where else to go. When your girlfriend kicks you out – “Forever,” she said – while you're on vacation together in the middle of nowhere, a ring in your pocket, ready to pop the question, and she says “I think we're over, Montag,” what do you do? She'd packed his bag and seen him out of the hotel, but that was it. He was too shocked to feel it.

He'd come here because it was the only other place to stay in this quaint little nowhere, aside from the rustic bed-and-breakfast they – Cherry was staying in. Of course he didn't like this place, didn't like how the single street lamp at the motel lot's edge warped the light, made the darkness only darker, the potholes like pits, the shadows like abysses. But Cherry had liked it, so here he was. She was only at the bed and breakfast because he’d convinced her to go. She had wanted to come here.

He picked up his suitcase and shuffled towards the motel's office, his free hand safe in his pocket, his eyes on his shoes, focusing, unfocusing, tearing occasionally. He bumbled through the door as a broken bell signified his entrance. The clerk, a bald and greasy forty-something, appeared out from his nook, closed his comic book and took his apathetic position at the desk.

“Hello, um, I'd like to rent a room for the evening?”

“Ungh,” the clerk groaned, “Alone?”

“N... Yes.”

“For how many hours?”

Montag blinked, “What?”

The clerk looked at him, unmoved, and repeated, “For how many hours?”

“Look, all I want is a clean room for the night, OK?”

The pig of a creature snorted and left the room. The room's lighting seemed to come to life in his absence, but only enough to further disconcert Montag. Behind the counter a few imitation candles flickered and blinked, struggling with their faulty bulbs. Holes in the wall pocked the cramped lobby, poorly hidden behind colorful, tattered veils, like a harem in ruin. The candles' struggle for life cast erratic shadows over the room, taking greater form when filtered through the veils. Dark spiders seemed to occupy the holes as the light writhed over them, staying just out of sight but dancing nevertheless at the struggle of the moribund illumination.

The clerk re-entered the room, obscuring the candles behind him. “Here,” he handed Montag a key, “Room twenty-four, second floor.” He then looked down at the register and began mumbling numbers and punching keys, crunching the cost for the interloper's stay.

Montag noticed the title of the clerk's comic, “Real Life Romance,” and managed a chuckle: “Heh, that's funny.”

“What?” the clerk grunted.

“Your comic. I just got dumped.”

“Stay 'til noon tomorrow and it'll be fifty-four dollars.”

He reached into his pocket for his wallet and thought he saw some dark arachnid crawl over one of the candles, casting weird shadows from the dying light. He shook his head and slid the clerk his card. The clerk rang him up, returned the card, and Montag took his suitcase and returned to the night.

The car had stopped running, and the room in front of it was dark. But the driver was still there. Still hadn't moved. Montag wondered if he'd just been dumped too. He thought about going over to the car, even walked halfway there, before the room's door opened and a lithe, disoriented-looking girl came out, a shawl wrapped around her shaky frame. She looked at him with her mouth open and head tipped to one side. He mumbled, “Oh, uh, I'm sorry,” and turned for the stairs to the second floor.

He hadn't understood what Cherry had seen in this place. Oh, she'd tried to explain -- “This place is so... different! It's so tacky, it even feels dangerous -- exciting!” -- but he never understood. She saw the edge of reason as an adventure. They shouldn't have been here, in this whore's hotel with the tacky paint and broken windows. But they lay together here a night long ago in the excitement of this place's wrongness. She had laughed at the night’s creaks and cracks, and in doing so gave him the courage to embrace it too. Without her now, only the numbness of her memory kept him from screaming.

Time had washed out what were probably once welcoming, earthy tones. The Indian-esque patterns woven into the carpet seemed jagged, while the off-color stripes constituting the wall-paper stood around him like figuring waiting at the edge of a clearing. The queen-sized bed looked rotted with disconcerting stains, while the room's two lamps cast more shadow than light, pressing weird patterns amongst the figures along the walls.

He was always looking over his shoulder when they came here, and Cherry would laugh at him and say something to melt his heart - “What a cutie, scared of the dark.” - but now she wasn't here. Now there was no laughter. Only him, and the room.

He set his briefcase by the nightstand and sat on the bed, which groaned and cried at his weight. He eyed the television for a moment, seeing himself looking back. What am I doing here? The reflection stared back, just as lost.

He took out his phone and, dialing her number, sighed.

“Hey!-”

“Cherry!”

“-You've reached Cherry's voice mail.-”

“Oh.”

“-So leave a message, your name, your number, and I'll get back to you! Thanks!”

“Cherry...”

He looked back at himself in the television, his reflection with the phone against his ear. He felt empty; the reflection looked confused.

“Cherry I love you. I don't know why you think we should be over, but love, I'll do anything to make this work. You mean the world to me, I'm... I don't know what to do without you.”

The reflection looked away and sighed, “Cherry... Just call me back. I love you.”

How can this be real? Three years.

The reflection looked back at him. Three years.

He took the remote and turned on the television, dispelling his mirror-self. Static roared into existence, and he just as quickly turned it off. He looked back at the phone, brought up her speed-dial, and... oh, what's the point. He shook his head, dropped the phone to the ground and his head to his hands. He cried.

By two AM, his eyes were too red to weep, his body too sore to cry. He lay his head down on the pillow and sobbed his last. He reached out and turned off the light, and closed his eyes.

Had he not faced away from the windows, he would have seen the girl from before, pale and expressionless, her muscles relaxed at all wrong angles. Instead, he wished the shadows against the wall didn't look so much like hands. Wished they'd stop... moving.

If he'd gone any closer to the car earlier, he'd have noticed the cause of the driver's stillness. She'd spilt his innards when she caught him. The man inside the room, she'd hurled against the walls. Those had been the figures darting: his body flying like a ragdoll tossed by an angry child. But her face carried no anger. Her face carried nothing. She was a vessel.

She stepped towards the window, and the hand-shadows flickered, growing longer. Montag shook his head and whimpered, wishing for nothing more than Cherry to be here and make the darkness an adventure. He rolled over and held his eyes shut, shaking half in fear and half in sadness, until he felt a touch on his shoulder.

He shot up in bed and looked at -- at Cherry. There she was, short black hair, grey eyes, little lips that naturally found themselves in a smile... there she was. "Oh god, love, you scared me."

"Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry for saying what I said. I didn't mean it, you know I love you. I just... we just need to talk, honey, but... but right now I need to tell you," she climbed up to him and planted her lips furtively on his, releasing only after dazing him with the kiss, "I need to tell you how sorry I am..."

"No,” Montag protested, pulling her close, “I just want to hold you. I couldn't stand the thought of...”

"Oh, god, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry," she kissed her way up his neck before landing her lips on his again for a wanting peck. "But,” she pulled away, “You said I scared you?"

"Oh god yeah, honey. How did you get in? I was terrified!"

"Oh, mmm..." she bit his ear and whispered, "Good."

"What?"

She reared back and howled. Infinite, ineffable darkness tore across her skin, sucking any light from the room into her abyssal form. It bulged into her head, her limbs, expanding, shedding her flesh in favor of its ghastly bulk. It burst out from within her, tossing pieces and parts around the room while strips of her flesh hung like off the writhing abomination like rags. It bent at wrong angles, twisting and wrenching his mind in the mere attempt to perceive this monstrosity. Screams accompanied the otherworldly emergence, both from the entity as it roared in from whatever terrible beyond spawned it and from Montag as his every sensation turned to pure and unspeakable horror.

But the misty darkness did not content itself there. It drew back and threw itself upon Montag, forcing itself in his eyes, through his ears, up his nose, in his mouth, and through his every pore. He felt it penetrate his mind, shoving his consciousness deeper and deeper into the primordial recesses, and the fear he had dared just call pure became a lowly speck before the ineffable doom that enveloped his soul now, for this thing would not kill him, he realized. It would enslave him, shackle him to his nightmares. He could already feel it, his awareness being locked away in the most untouchable places of the human psyche where he would reside, chained and imprisoned,  like the man in the car, like the one in the room, like the farm girl this thing had taken as its first victim, as its vessel until Montag. For all eternity, the thing warned, would he cry out for the release of his mortal coil. And for all eternity would he be denied. 

It wracked his memories, finding names, places, victims all. He tried to resist, to keep Cherry's name safe in his mind, but it only hurled him further into his nightmares -- and her memory closer to the shadow’s maw.

He reached his hand out, struggling to keep it his own, and whispered her name. He wrestled with the thing for his other arm, for his limbs, and lifted himself from the bed, standing in the darkness as his body shook with the conflict. He plodded towards the door in heavy steps, leaving wispy shadows in his wake. He hadn't the control to open the door, so the beast phased him through it, like she had done through the window as the former vessel Kathryn had fought to inform Montag, to save him from this fate. The thing cackled in Montag's mind, washing him with the inhuman sound of its intentions, while it drank his silent, never-ending screams.

And there she was, Cherry, the real Cherry, driving into the motel's parking lot. She stepped out of the car as the abyssal specter's laughter grew to a roar.

“Montag!” she climbed out and shouted to him, “Honey, I made a mistake! I'm so sorry. Come down, we need to talk!”

He tried to gasp her name, wheezing hard through the spasms. The thing forced a grin onto his dead face, as behind him Kathryn's limbs pulled themselves together. The broken body in the room below crawled with crushed bones to the door. The eviscerated one in the car pulled his guts back inside and stepped out of the vehicle. The clerk's spider-infested body struggled onto the lot. At the sight of such nightmares, Cherry made to scream, but Montag appeared by her in a wisp of black smoke and clamped his hand over her mouth. Tears graced them both.

The thing's joy knew no bounds.
