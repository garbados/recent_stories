title: Chimera

Trumpets and standards welcomed them through the heavy doors, dripping in ornate carvings and steel braces, into a hall lavish in furs and expensive stained glass, braziers warming the approach to the Count's throne, where sat a man noble and aged looking upon something he never thought to see praised as anything but monstrous: four chimera. Warlock's abominations! -- but now was no time for tradition, and so he stood for his guests.

"Welcome, honored travellers, and thanks to you for honoring my summons!"

By Deus, look at them. An upright bear as tall as two men, audacious enough to don full plate in the presence of nobility, or that rat-man in spectacles, holding his brother - a frothing hyena of all things - tight on a leash! Family indeed.

"Bartleby -- that is your name, bearling, is it not? Fear not for retribution and undon yon armor, for this is a company of comrades. And, Johannes, famed scholar, is it right of a sibling to so choke and fetter his own brother?"

The band continued to advance towards the throne, between the long rows of knights at the count's service, though Jericho the fox stepped faster to speak first to their host.

"Count Balab, it is our honor to be the recipients of such notable summons as yours, but being we creatures of such... unnatural sources," the beast hid a wince, to blaspheme his blood, "bear us patience in our caution, for man has not been such a kind host as you, sire."

"Very well, and well spoken, good Jericho! I shall mind such things better, and inform my servitors of the same," and, under his breath to his closest advisor Malachi aside his throne, "If they do not cooperate, slay them. If they do, slay them post-duty. These magician-spawn reek of foul taint."

At this, though unheard to the rest, Septimus leapt against his leash, howling and laughing wildly as Johannes struggled to restrain him, until at last he hauled his brother up by the collar and looked him in his wild eyes, they sharing a look in the stunned hall until Johannes let fall his captive with a clatter yet held tight to the restraint. His brothers had stopped their pace alongside his.

"Count, I warn you, do not so lightly threaten the monsters that drove horror into your forefather's hearts."

"You jest, Johannes, for I am but all confused!"

"Malachi," Johannes released one hand fron the leash, pointed it at the advisor and swirled his fingers in some arcane motion, "Repeat what last the count ordered."

The underling shot up, straight as wheat, and shouted clear and unwavering, "IF THEY DO NOT COOPERATE, SLAY THEM. IF THEY DO, SLAY THEM POST-DUTY. THESE MAGICIAN-SPAWN REEK OF FOUL TAINT."

As the hall gasped, Bartleby whispered to Jericho, "I tol' you he'd do this. You owe me dinner."

"These orders surprise no one, treacherous swine!" Johannes continued, "Behold the braces at the entrance: measures to hold back a mutinous people; or the extravagant holdings of such a tiny county: yea, these riches are the splendors of the exploited. And behold your armor, each of you knights! Amongst proper company, would you not don but noble's garb and hold your sword astride merely for ceremony? Truly, for here amongst the company of magician-spawn you suit yourselves in the garb of war and prepare for slaughter. Verily, yours are truly honorable summons, Balab!" He spat at the count's feet as the guard unsheathed their swords, though Jericho had in the moment drawn and re-sheathed his dagger in the throat of the nearest knight before cursing at his haste. Septimus whined to be released.

"Fine, Bart, I'll buy you two dinners, big fat fried bass feasts, if you never mention betting again."

"What?" Bartleby chuckled, his voice booming in the silence, "I didn' say nuffin."

Johannes let Septimus leap on the leash at Balab and hissed, "I dare you. Kill us."

The rat's eyes burned into his skull, his every word searing and penetrating, threatening insanity with every syllable.

"Give the order. Just try it. I dare you."

"Aw, Joe, do we really gots ta kill all of 'em? I mean, half 'em already done and pissed theyselves, even I can smell it."

"Bugger, good enough by me if it gets Johannes off his high horse for five minutes."

Johannes broke his gaze with Balab, "Hmm," he said, relinquishing a smile, "fine by me," and at long last released Septimus, who spared no expense to wholly mutilate Balab and his advisors, while Bartleby rattled the hall with his roars and proceeded to smash through the ranks of petrified knights and Jericho tumbled about the melee, congratulating himself with every thrust to weave through armor, or every blade narrowly avoided, as Johannes swept up to the throne and grasped Balab's barely breathing body by the skull.

"You know something about our fathers. Something you will tell us."

The count seized up and writhed, resisting the rat's magics to the last, but Johannes would not be deterred: "A fate worse than the darkest pit of Abaddon awaits fools who die at my hands, Balab, now divulge!" But no matter how much mana the apprentice wizard poured into his victim, the information would not budge from his mind's death-grip, until at last Balab was but a corpse in Johannes' furious clutches. He gave an enraged grunt before turning back to the battle, where Bartleby and Jericho had convinced the guard to flee, though only a handful lay even wounded, and only the one of Jericho's haste might die of the day. Septimus returned to Johannes' heel, nuzzling his side, his chaps bloody with satisfaction. He re-leashed his brother and the band made its way back into sunlight, where the city-folk fled at their sight.

"So, Joe, I know it warn't part of the plan far as I was aware up til â€˜bout, oh, a minute ago, but did Balab tell you what che wanted ta know?"

Johannes scowled, "Not yet," as he fingered the black pearl around his neck, listening to the count's tortured screams within, "not yet."
