## An excerpt from world of *Ex Deus*

Abyssals. The barkeep's lips draw tight and a patron grows a sneer as the three tall things enter, faces like glass mosaics, eyes hidden like black pearls beneath the crystal shards. Their hooves ring distinct amongst the pub's clatter and din, many a man and maid stopping their chatter at their entrance. Whether those who yet spoke are fools or sages remained to be seen.

Common leather cuirasses and peasant trousers hide much of their alien skin, a thing of ineffable wonder -- or horror, depending on who you ask. Two of the three stay by the door as the third pads to the barkeep, slivers and splinters of the beyond worming in and out of the air about her. Her air seems to be full of insects that disappear with each blink, like beings in the corner of your eyes, right in front of you.

"Abyss-cha locute?" she asks, laying a hand of too-long fingers on the bar's hard wood.

"Ah, no," replies the human, "I speak O'tarl, Dryz, Immun... pretty much everything but Abyssal, really."

"That is fine," she replies, the foreign words echoing through the air as if uttered by a dozen mouths in sporadic succession, "We look for... Haf with..." She pauses, looking for the words.

"Get out of here, mana-whore!" some rash and wolven O'tte shouts, his flame-streaked ears folded back in aggression. If she had understood, she might have been offended, but she looked up at him all the same -- only to find sitting two tables behind him their target.

As soon as their eyes lock, he leaps from his seat, driving it back. Where the Abyssals stand tall at six feet and some inches, this Haf lord occupies an easy eight feet of vertical space, his rough and rocky skin bulging with molten veins. "You want me?!" he shouts as his pursuer moves from the bar, "COME AND GET ME."

Patrons scramble from their seats as the two Abyssals by the door side-step the masses and step briskly toward the Haf. Their female partner grabs by the throat the insulting O'tte as he flees, his red fur turning a sickly white as a blue mist seeps from his open mouth into his captor's eyes. Her black eyes burn darker when she says, "Thank you," and drops the drained thing.

"Xre," one of them by the door calls out in Abyss-cha, "Occupy him. Quryl, keep that good air handy for when he's ready to give up," before fading into the air, vanished.

As Quryl skips away from the drained O'tte, the other male, Xre, roars at the charging Haf with a voice that shatters into myriad tones, all at once harmonic and discordant. His hands meet the calloused palms of his attacker. The force drives him back, but his hooves stay steady and standing -- until one of the Haf's rock fists slams into his stomach. He flies back and across a table, groaning for only an instant before beginning to laugh, even as the Haf beats his chest and cries victory. Xre's laughter grows deep as lightning whips across his body, snapping limbs with sickening cracks, his body bursting with sudden, sporadic growths.

"We are Abyssal," Quryl shouts, "Beings from Beyond. Be not so proud, rock-thing."

Their target turns to face Quryl, but returns to Xre in time to see a terror rise from where he had sent the Abyssal sprawling. Bulging arms with too many limbs sprout from a torso black as night, as legs that live only long enough to take the next step before bursting into shadow carry Xre forward, his laughter having become a chorus cry of horror.

The Haf steps back -- and into Quryl's waiting touch. Her hands on his spine, a six-legged spirit races from her fingertips up his back and burrows into the base of his skull. The next few seconds are instants of sanity-shattering madness for the Haf, as his mind is forced through a hole in reality to look upon the lawless infinity of the Abyss. Protected by only the weakest of barriers, the unspeakable depths of Beyond pour through and rack his mind, running over his brain like acid over flesh: thoughts burst like bombs as ideas in dying whip and lash the space around them, and blood begins to drip from the poor thing's eyes.

Returned to reality, the shocked beast drops to his knees just in time for the third agent to reassemble himself in air just behind him, cracking him across the back of the skull with a blackjack. Where once only stunned, their target now flops to the ground, unconscious.

"Still alive, too," he remarks.

"After Justice sees to him," Quryl laughs, "We'll see."
