# No Greater Act

When the world ends, I want it to be slow.

I want to watch the clouds part for the blinding visage of Deus. I want to see his beauty scorch the earth.

I want to be held in awe as the ground cracks and shatters beneath my feet. I want my eyes to bleed in agony and terror as his glory crushes civilization. Skyscrapers will crumple, the air will burn, and the sky will tremble.

The stars will tumble to earth, white hot and furious. They will cleave through our towers and impact with such force that boulders will be given wings. I want to see Deus slam the oceans with his fists, tsunamis radiating in their wake to crush the coasts and drown the land. I want to see the starfire doused in waves so high they catch birds.

I will carefully shield my eyes and watch as other survivors become as ash or salt when they meet the eyes of God. I will stand paralyzed as he rips mountains from their earthly moors and effortlessly hurls them. Time will stretch forever as Kilimanjaro sails above us, only to crash and crumple into a metropolis on the horizon. Tornadoes to engulf whole towns will catch the refuse in their swirl, whipping cars, buildings, and hundreds upon hundreds of bodies around and around, whistling a siren's song. If I am alive then, tears will be insufficient to describe my horror.

I want to see the world end in ways so stupefying, so glorious, so powerful, that not only would my words, nay, my very imagination be incapable of rendering it, but that if after Deus has disappeared into the heavens I am still alive, I would die by simple virtue of the Armageddon's awesome might. I would die because there would be no greater act left to witness.
