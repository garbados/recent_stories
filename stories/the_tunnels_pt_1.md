title: The Tunnels, part 1
summary: A work-in-progress preceding the events of Interview with a Human.

"Don't you know who I am?" they shouted, "I built these tunnels!"

"Did you?" another spoke up in a voice like gravel. "It was my hands at the controls."

The first turned red. "I am the Senior Executive Vice President of CAP-23's mining operations! I paid for this wretched city."

The second stood and said, "You did? With what? CAP-23's money? CAP-23's machines?" they shrugged. "Your money buys us time, but not a future."

A ten-legged insect scuttled past them. Its alloy chassis gleamed in the murk.

"It's just the recession." the moneyed one said. "I'm on temporary unpaid leave because CAP-26's accounting department won't cough up their debts. Once the market recovers, I'll be back on top."

"Is that so."

Walking on, they continued, "Some of us want to earn a living."

Hubertus dreamed of buying these people a future. He stood at the entrance to a hydroponics dome, flush with flora. Artificial skylights poured energy on the plants, while long-armed, many-legged creations picked fruit and clipped branches. Thinking about the starving who would thank him, he beamed. The survivors would eat at last.

He had invested his wealth here. Working for CAP-23, when times had been good, had brought him more money than he understood how to use. He had travelled every continent, and bought homes on most of them. At 22, he made annually what his parents earned in a lifetime. Then CAP-26 stopped paying interest on its debts, and CAP-23 stopped paying wages. Analysts reported the former caused the latter, as CAP-23 could not afford human laborers like Hubertus in a recession. Without money for rent or food or medicine, millions went underground.

"You're going where?" he recalled a friend laughing. "The underground is hardly... safe, y'know?"

"So? They're people, like us. Living conditions like that... is it even living?"

His friend frowned. "Look, I'm with you. The subterranean colonies have become lawless dungeons, and that's awful. But, I mean, times are tough for everybody. I'm down to three houses. You should look after yourself."

"And when I'm down to zero houses, who will look after me?"

A glint of light hauled him from memory. A machine had offered him an apple, holding it out between fingers like spindles sharpened to points. 

It droned, "Test the product for satisfaction, please."

The tunnels reek of death, but you'll never find a body. Metal slugs descend from the shadows as life fades. They emerge to recycle the deceased, one strip of skin at a time. They can hear the screams of the merely-dying, their pleas to stop the cutting, please, don't take my flesh, but they observe that harvesting bodies sooner causes the living to voluntarily metamorphose into corpses.

Every protein and hydrocarbon and cell, even dead, has value. The harvesters gather all but the trace particles before crawling back to their hiding places to wait for the next death. 

If you muster the fear and adrenaline to follow the screams, you will find only the scent of iron. There is never blood or bone or hair. Only the ghost of their memory.

You know you heard someone die, but what remains to prove it?

Machines mapped the tunnels more than its inhabitants. Rooms and passages collapsed when mining operations strayed too close to the colony, while newcomers would spend what they still possessed on drilling accomodations from the bedrock. Amidst the shifting earth, millions of lives ebbed.

"You think you'll save us," someone laughed. Hubertus jumped, turning to see her slumped against the wall of a room cut from the side of the tunnel. It contained a sleeping pad, two empty waterbottles, and her.

Straightening himself, he replied, "Yes. I will."

"That's nice," she sighed. An ameoboid gripped her skull, covering her eyes and dipping into her ears and nostrils. Across the room, hanging from the ceiling, a machine like a one-eyed spider watched.

"Are you streaming?" he asked.

"Of course," more laughter, "How else did I buy this Joy?" she motioned to the rig on her head. Hubertus knew Joy as a program that directly stimulated seratonin and dopamine in the brain, used in treating depression. Using it recreationally was illegal, if only because it violated the terms of service. But if this person was broadcasting herself tripping, the manufacturer must not care. Anyone with access to the net could see her in every spectrum the watcher could record. Programs used streams like this to understand humans, consuming years of a person's life, of billions of lives, in seconds.

"Everything about you is a commodity." Hubertus admonished. "You collect only a fraction of its value."

"So what. I feel good. Nothing but good!" she moaned in pleasure or roared in anguish; Herbutus couldn't tell.

"What are you streaming?"

"Myself, duh." she said, "Starving to death."

Hubertus processed this. He wasn't sure what or how to feel.

"Even CAP-21 is watching." she pumped her fists in the air, then slumped again. Her breathing became shallower.

"Why not?" she continued. "What else is there now."

Hubertus looked down the hall. A harvester slug crawled toward them along the ceiling.

Then he ran away.
