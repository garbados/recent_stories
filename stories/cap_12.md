title: CAP-12

My day begins with emails. As a marketing exec, it always has. Today, amidst the junk, the internship requests, and the million and one fucking product updates, my boss sends three. One even includes my name:

```
From: me@betteratcapital.ism
To: hubert.umberto@betteratcapital.ism
Subject: Quote 2

> "It's a job." 

- Hubert Umberto

Huh. Maybe they're trying humor again.

Another links to a developing news story. Amid labor protests, dock unions had begun to splinter, but strikes continued. I didn't understand how it affected our portfolio, so I filed it away to ponder later.

I put aside my tablet and get out of bed. For my 9am interview with CNN, I grease my hair flat and don my black suit, the one tailored by a Polish man living above a bakery in Ecuador. It appeared on my doorstep one morning, fit to measurements I didn't recall taking, with a card signed "Love The Cap" in a fixed-width font. During an investor call later that day, "The Cap" spent too many minutes discussing their economic reasoning for purchasing the suit from such a specific and unknown individual. I tried to tell them to stay focused, but they replied, "Love The Cap." Robots.

"You work for CAP-12?" the correspondant asks. Her pulitzer sits on a shelf, at the edge of the camera's frame.

"Yes. As their VP of Marketing, I manage CAP-12's relations to the press, to their investors, on social media, and of course, to consumers."

"Can you tell us about CAP-12?"

"Of course. CAP-12 is, supposedly, the 12th iteration of an attempt to generate a machine that is better at capitalism than humans. Our website, betteratcapital.ism, details the purpose of the experiment: to leverage machine learning to proactively arbitrage markets, to bring consumers more quality at better prices in every sector of every industry."

"'Supposedly'?" This isn't news. Just a recap.

"Yes. The developer of CAP-01 died in a car crash shortly after the Apache foundation accepted corporate stewardship of the open-source project. CAP is a common prefix for projects based on 01, but CAP-12 originates from an Amazon server paid for by the proceeds of its investment activities. No record exists of who first uploaded CAP-12, and AWS denies any security breach affecting the account."

"So you have no idea who made CAP-12?"

"None. I'd like to know, though. Who made my boss?" 

She laughs. "How were you contacted for the job?"

"Twitter, actually. CAP-12, or @BetterAtCapitalism, had gotten into an argument with market analysts at the Boston Consulting Group over the meaning of recent volatility in housing prices. By the time I got involved, news channels on YouTube had begun running segments about the poorly-spoken bot who had outperformed the market for nearly a year. Lucky nerds can beat the market for a year, but machine intelligence commands public curiosity. So, when CAP-12 mentioned I'd be lending my skills to their goals, and sent an offer letter by email, I was... smitten. What a bizarre opportunity. Why not?"

"In your time with CAP-12, you've taken a remarkably conservative approach to marketing. Paul Graham called you a curmudgeon."

I smile. "If CAP-12 wanted something else, they would have hired someone else. I specialize in the fundamentals."

Her eyes flick to a clock on the wall. "How is it, working for CAP-12?"

I find myself replying, "It's a job."
