summary: When those we love seem as monsters, does our defense violence them, or the horror they have become?

"Tanya... Tanya...!" Her grandmother gasps from the hallway. Tanya hides in her room, safe -- she hopes -- behind a locked door.

"Gran, you're sick! You need to leave!"

Her grandmother falls, with the sound of cracking bones and squelching flesh. "Tanya..." she whispers after a moment, and proceeds to drag herself onward. "Taaaanya..."

Tanya hunts through her closet for anything she might use to defend herself. The power went out days ago, so in the dark she can trust only her hands. Something long and sturdy -- that should do. She takes it and goes to the window.

"Gran, I'm not kidding! I don't want to hurt you! Get out of here!"

"Tanyaaa!" She slams on the door with a curious strength.

Tanya pulls the blinds on her room, so her flashlight doesn't attract too much attention. As the door weakens under her grandmother's aggression, Tanya sets her flashlight on a stack of pillows, facing the door, and turns it on. The light blinds her for an instant, and the door's lock breaks and her grandmother, back on her feet, stands at the entrance.

The weeks since her death show. Her flesh, where it has not fallen away, has turned black and green. Her eyes -- bulging and yellowed -- spin wildly in the light, and her utterance -- "Taaaaanyaaaaa!" -- sounds as much like a cry of pain as a moan of hunger.

Tanya slams her lacrosse stick into this thing's face. As the stick's metal breaks its nose yet again, it blithers through shattered teeth, "Tayna..." 

She wonders somewhere deep in her mind, "Was this once my grandmother, or does this nightmare only wear her skin? When I have beaten it back into death, will I have slain a monster out for my life, or my own kin?" As she drives the zombie's blackened blood from its festering body, she decides to think about it later.
