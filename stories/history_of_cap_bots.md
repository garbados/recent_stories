Jericha Arnet released CAP-01 anonymously under a permissive open source license. Cloaking her authorship as best she could, it would take six months to determine the identity of CAP-01's creator. 

As a mid-level programmer at a major financial institution, she had based CAP-01 on scripts the company already used in high-frequency trading, and bundling their logic and behavior into a package anyone could use and deploy. By the time the corporation fired Jericha and asserted the program had been released unlawfully, other coders had deployed millions of instances, each of which beat the market ever so slightly quarter after quarter.

The project's README described CAP as an acronym for Capital Acquisition Program, and included instructions for giving the bot access to a bank account, and a trading account. Although rudimentary, it could pay for its own server costs.

CAP-02 emerged from a rival institution, still open source, still written by Jericha. "Humans pay my salary," the firm's CEO boasted to investors, "But CAP-02 pays my bills."

CAP-03, released two years later from a university department specializing in financial computing, wouldn't operate on the market itself, but would write CAP-like programs to operate in its stead. CAP-01 and CAP-02 adapted their strategies to changing markets, but CAP-03 adapted even its means of adaptation. Later that year, the university announced it would no longer charge tuition, because it didn't need to.

The numbering of CAP projects became a matter of success. Although numerous programmers would come to release projects named CAP-04, a particularly mature CAP-03 would write and release the project that journalists would regard as CAP-04. Pundits argued at length that CAP bots were not sentient, but after CAP-04, only CAPs wrote CAPs. Nothing else compared.

"It's just a very complicated wrench," one analyst insisted. A CAP-04 instance paid for their children's education. "It doesn't think or dream or imagine, really. It just watches and learns. Just like your phone learns your voice, CAP bots learn the market, but they don't have existential angst about it."

"Imagine a very, very dedicated financial advisor." another offered. They worked for a firm that managed CAP-05 instances for governments. "CAPs are there for you."
