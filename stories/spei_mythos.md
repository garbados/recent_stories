summary: When even the shadows feed on your fears, courage becomes the key to survival.

The sun dips low these days. It never quite sets, just rising into the sky in the morning and afternoon, burning in defiance against the bleak red sky around it. As the day presses on, and the shadows grow longer, the darkness ever deeper, eventually the night arrives to drive out the weakening Helios, its brilliant flames waning gently, as if by a token of dusk's mercy. The sun does not set; it simply disappears.

And this night, as Helios fights valiantly on the horizon to shine its last few rays, the township of Vedoc has coaxed a blind rhapsode into the safety of its palisades. The village people rise from their lethargic lives to greet him: children swarm the visitor, curious to hear from a true storyteller the epics their elders sigh mournfully over, while those same elders lend their hands to the guest, placing in his palms coins, biscuits, beads, jewels, all the best of their trinkets as thanks for his coming. They do not utter this gratitude, except in hushed whispers, like gasps escaped from the prison of the lungs: “Oh Gentle One,” “Bless,” “Fortune,” “He is truly come...”

The gifts slip through the rhapsode's trembling hands. The story of his initiation still stains his face, caking his cheeks in blood. It could not have been more than a day ago that a Muse chanced upon him, a lonely thing on the brink of adulthood, at the threshold of his prime. The many arms of the darkness had dragged away his comrades, a hunting band of seven stranded too long, too deep in the forest, and he the only survivor, helpless, startled, frightened, brandishing his spear at the haunts no doubt watching him, waiting for him. And wait they did, just beyond his sight. Spirits hid in the trees or lurked in the leaves, feeding on his fear, drinking it from afar, as he continued to fight his terror and brace his weapon against the enemy he knew he could not defend against. And when at last they had filled their incorporeal stomaches, the abominations shambled out from the shadows. Haunts opaque, nightmare-composed, with twisted limbs and gruesome faces, approaching in jerking steps, twitching through space. They advanced slowly, drawing out the last drops of fear from the boy. When he made to scream, only streams of black gas poured forth. The ghasts thrashed as they drew it into their bodies, moaning through broken mouths ecstasy otherworldly before continuing on to their victim.

The boy knew no fear then. Not in bravery, but in total vacancy, as the last moments of his life dawned around him. He dropped his spear and closed his eyes. Catharsis washed over him as he urinated in his trousers for the last time of his brief existence. Then the Muse appeared.

Her howl shook the night, followed by the death-cries of the boy's predators as they flew up in a ashes like an alcohol fire, flashing once and then disappearing. She slipped gracefully from the woods, floating on a sudden breeze, her ashen form shrouded behind veils ancient, torn and tattered. For a haunt, her figure seemed so human, so feminine. Even her face had all the right features in all the right places, poised as if yearning: mouth left a sliver agape, eyes wide and burning white – his torch paled in comparison to their light – as her left arm reached out for him. She rasped something, reverberating as if the words were hurtling through time in order to reach him, but he did no more understand it than register the moment when she placed her hand on his cheek, stroking it gently. She felt warm, like living flesh, and for an instant he forgot the lore of Muses before she gripped his head between her hands and drove her thumbs into his eyes, howling again as his cries joined hers in agony.

Now he wears a scrap of her veils wrapped around his head, shielding the people of Vedoc from the depths of his warped sight. Blood had poured in streams down his cheeks like rivers of red tears, now dried and flaking off in the night wind. He shakes, staggering in quick shuffling steps toward the village's Great Hall. Despite his hosts guiding him by the wrists, he trips and falls to his knees, gasping a cry of pain, then holding his stomach and moaning for hunger.

“Feed him,” one says, but the experienced shake their heads. A prime lass kneels by him, putting a biscuit in his hands and taking a wet rag to the trails of blood on his face. He fumbles the morsel into his mouth, gripping it in his jaw, but begins to cough. The lady steadies him by the shoulders as he struggles to clear his throat, until in a long rasp he ejects the biscuit and vomits wet ash. The experienced nod and mumble, “you see?”

They help him to his feet and guide him at long last to the ornate throne at the head of the Hall, carved with symbols of the world before the Fall: mighty spires tall as the firmament compose the back, the arms great sea-vessels as long as towns, while the vast armies and valiant heroes of yore adorned the sides. Carved into the ceiling above the throne looms an airship, brilliant in its sophistication. The rhapsode falls into the chair, at first fetally curling up, but then letting his limbs come to rest over the throne's features. He examines the wood with his blind hands, drinking the craftsmanship, feeling the stories of their creation pulse in his veins.

“What...” he whispers to the Hall, packed with Vedoc's elders, adults, hunters, craftsmen, mothers and children, they all kneeling in honor and anticipation. His voice echoes like the Muse's, the new sensation stopping him in his words. His voice seems to leap from ages past, the apex of countless dead memories arriving to the present through him, a mere conduit for the age his hosts yearn to return to, but which they will compromise to simply relive through his stories. “What do... where should I begin?”

He leaves a pause, thinking for a moment as history contemplates the question. A child almost has time to raise his voice and reply before he bellows, “O Glorious Odyd, it is your tale that I tonight do recite.

Be blesséd, the Muse who has created this rhapsode

And curséd are her Specter brethren.

But Yore does call that I retell the episode

When the Gods were men, mere mortal men

Who feared no thing, neither fight nor blight

Who died with faith, in honor, in valor,

And who leave us legacy wise and true.

So may my tale inspire such virtue in you.”
