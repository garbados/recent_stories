title: The Specter
summary: A fear-monger enjoys his favorite show.

I stay up late watching Fear Factoid. Contestants sit, strapped to a chair, answering trivia while terror-inducing neurochemicals are pumped into the room. The longer it takes them to complete the battery of questions, the more horrified they become. They can bow out any time, but the million dollar prize keeps them in.

I watch as their eyes go wide, and a simple moment of hesitation over an answer explodes into a frantic search through the shadows for nightmares come alive. They sweat and shake, lips trembling as they struggle to resist the fruits of their imagination.

“It’s only the gas… it’s only the gas…” One mutters, clenching his fists to keep calm.

The host replies, calmly, “Is that your final answer?”

He bursts out laughing, but the laughter turns to screams. You can get a sense of each contestant’s worst nightmares through their pleas, but this one just screams. I put another twizzler between my teeth as the camera closes up on the contestant’s face. He has no reservation now, as he shakes and twists and thrashes to escape his confines within the chair. His nightmares have consumed him. As his screams turn to sobs, I wonder if he retains the cognizance to bow out.

The gas continues pumping, and the host repeats, “Is that your final answer?”
