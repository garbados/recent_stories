title: Interview with a Genejack

Jack. Genejack, I am called. I work in the borehole mines, where the earth's crust gives way to mantle. It is very hot there; I sweat much.

*Jack, do you like what you do?*

Tremendously. It is what gives me meaning.

*How long have you been a borehole miner?*

All of my life, so... almost two years. I am the oldest of my work team.

*Tell us more about the borehole, Jack.*

There are hundreds of us down there, along with the robots we are replacing. They are heavy things from the last century; large and inarticulate with their motions. They waste many minerals with their stodgy limbs. All the heat-shields across their bodies limit their range of motion. We genejacks are not as strong as the robots -- we are only human, after all -- but we have been bred to withstand the heat better over time, and our flesh is more agile than metal. Sometimes I wish I were a robot though, because they never have to leave the borehole. They mine and mine and mine for days, while our bodies shrivel before the heat after only half a day. Half a day! Twelve hours of work, and then I must rest. Must! Every day when I leave the borehole, it is agony, and a part of me fantasizes about remaining, about working until my limbs shrivel from dehydration and I fall dead on my tools. Dying for love of work; I can imagine no greater honor.

*Why can't you keep working?*

Water evaporates instantly in the mines. Only our tough skin and work suits keep our blood from boiling. The suits try to funnel our sweat back into our body, to keep us hydrated longer, but most of it has turned to vapor by the time it reaches my lips again. For every gallon I sweat, only a few drops are reclaimed.

*Is that how most genejacks die?*

From dehydration? Yes. But it is not as though we do not know the risks. Sometimes we merely love our work too much. As we get older, it becomes harder to read our bodies, and know when we must stop today to begin tomorrow. I limit myself and my team to twelve hours, because I know that is how much we can take. The younger genejacks get angry at me for stopping them, but I tell them they will thank me when they are old and full of memories, rather than dead and full of foolishness. There are also cave-ins, lava floes, equipment malfunctions -- all manner of dangers. We tell stories about the particularly mythic ones, like when Strongman held a tunnel up with his bare hands for a day, so his team could harvest a little motherlode. He was truly selfless, and when the tunnel crushed him, he died for love of work. He is a hero.

*How long do genejacks live?*

Usually a year. I am old; my team makes fun of me for it. They say, Wrinkles, how do you use this new tool? But they know it is so new, I do not know. I must get the younger genejacks to teach me again and again.

*They call you Wrinkles? Is that an insult?*

No, no, it is my name among genejacks, because I am old, so I have wrinkles. To topworlders, I am Jack. Or sometimes John. But what about me is Jack-like? or John-like? I do not know what a Jack or a John is, maybe because I am not a topworlder, maybe because the topworld is simply strange.

*The topworld. You mean the world above the mines?*

Yes, more or less. That is what it first meant, but now that genejacks do many things, both below the earth and upon it, it means the places we see no reason to go, and the people who frequent such places. Parks. Museums. Schools. Concert halls. Unless you are a music-jack, then the concert hall is your life. I met a music-jack once, when company management showed me off at a genetics convention. Apparently my age makes me impressive to topworlders, so they showed me off to other executives. I had never seen so many topworlders; you are all so small! Only six feet tall, if that, and with the puniest limbs. I understand why you need genejacks to do all the real work, because you yourselves cannot do anything but think and talk. Hah hah hah, who am I kidding? Listen to me talking, yap yap yap, like a topworlder.

*You mentioned meeting a music-jack?*

Oh, yes. I got bored of the executives and their banter, so I wandered off to explore. I heard music in the basement under the convention, so I followed it, and met Dolce, a music-jack. He was small and limber like a topworlder, but with many more limbs: four arms, and hands with six fingers. He was playing a fiddle and a violin in harmony, while singing something gentle and sweet in a language I do not know. It was beautiful: sophisticated, like getting minerals from a volatile area, but soft like the pleasure of simply drilling. I had never met a music-jack, but I knew he was not a topworlder. When he finished his song, I clapped, and he bowed. We talked, but did not have much to say. "This convention is boring. Topworlders are strange." "Yes. That is why I am here playing." "I wish I was in the mines." "I wish I was practicing." I knew I could not leave until the convention was over, so instead I sat with Dolce and listened while he continued to play. We did not say much, but I knew we felt the same about everything: about work, about life, about topworlders.

*How do you feel about topworlders?*

They are strange. Many of them protested the convention, saying we genejacks are mistreated. I laughed at them. The only way I was being mistreated was by being kept from the mines for so long! They said it is cruel to create humans for backbreaking labor. Do you see my back? Is it broken? No, only frail topworlders would break in the mines. We genejacks are made of tougher things. One sign demanded we be limited to eight hour days. That made me especially angry, so I waded into the crowd, took the sign, and scrawled a one next to the eight, then paraded around demanding my rights like a silly topworlder. "18 hour days! It's only fair! Why do you punish us with anything less?" I took the sign with me as a souvenir to show my team.

*What did they think of that?*

They thought it was funny, but the more we thought about it, the more we started taking it seriously.

*Working only eight hours a day?*

No, no, working eighteen. Our heatsuits are old technology, and I know the company can do better. With better heatsuits, we could work longer, which all the genejacks want. My team assumed the company would like the idea, too -- longer hours, more minerals, yes? -- but every topworlder I proposed it to dismissed the idea and spoke to me like I were a child. "We can't simply poof better heatsuits into existence, genejack." They think they are smarter than us, because they made us; they think we are stupid, because we have never been to school. I have been to the best school there is: the deepest layers of this planet! I have spoken with every rock and vein there, every fossil and lava floe, and I have learned everything there is to know about mining. And Dolce, he has been to the best school there is, too: a life spent in music. There is not a moment he or I do not spend learning, practicing, and applying what we know. Can any topworlder say the same? Is any topworlder so dedicated? How can they look down at us when we are so much stronger, so much more agile, so much smarter than they are?

*But topworlders made you. They make all genejacks. Without them, you wouldn't be here.*

[Jack snorts, then slowly eases] Yes. Yes, you are right. For this I must thank them, for giving me the glorious life I live. Sometimes I just wish they would not hold it over us, the way they do. We are people too, after all.
