### Spring 1898

#### From the journal of Avdei Novikov:

"Theirs has become a land of shadow.

I had been to England once before, as a child. Then, the island-nation had been as vibrant an imperial mother, arguably the /most/ vibrant, as any other in Europe. Her streets were rotten with industrial filth, though oddly rich in exotic bounties, while her populace starved in body and spirit but waddled fat and full with philosophy. Fog owned those marshy lands, from her most verdant and glistening fields to her deepest, darkest bogs. The only thing I recognize now is the fog.

This age we call Enlightenment has from this land evaporated. Men toil fearfully, mindlessly, in the wake of shattered castles. No man dares tell me what forces brought to kneel such mighty constructions, only to shiver and quake in nervous silence before scurrying away into the mists. Larger creatures stare at me from the shadows, and bully the poor things who dare reply to my greetings.

London is no more. I came upon it yesterday, but found only ruin: charred wood, ashen corpses, seared stones -- were I less a skeptic I'd say thar had been dragons. At the center lay the most shocking thing of all: a hole. No starry crater, but a gaping pit. The sight of it unnerved me, and I could not remain there longer than to drop a stone into the abyssal maw and never hear it land. I forbid my mind these thoughts, but my memory recalls with jarring clarity the sound of whispers of unknown languages rising from the hole. In my dreams the whispers take the shapes of terrifying songs, as I wander alone amidst Cyclopean architecture, moved to terror by its otherworldly nature. And in the distance looms a shape I refuse to see. I bless my spirit that it would bar from me this creature's full visage, for even the wisps and traces of its nature that penetrate my resistance are demoniac nightmares to drive men mad.

Whatever events have led England to where she now stands have rid her of any semblance of government. Men, women, and children all toil without masters for reasons no one will divulge, but in their numbed eyes I see the traces of scarring memories. I remain a skeptic, but with every passing day here, as my nightmares grow more vivid and the people more like numb rats, I cannot help but suspect that this is no human doing."

### Fall 1898

#### "London, Seat of Yeth"

A darkness has fallen over London. Its ruined streets have for long been empty, and whatever survivors remain wear moribund pallors. They haunt the town like transient ghasts, living while they should be dead, dead where they should be living.

Then came the Northerners, pagan monks in beastly attire, shambling forth beneath heavy black hides, furs, and feathers, heads shielded from view by the skulls of animals. Against the crumbling stones and broken people of a once-united kingdom's capital, they are fearsome, alien things. Onlookers watch, but do not dare to act.

One lifts his head and sniffs, snorts the air. "Kgehk'khm," he grunts through chords bloated and inhuman. The others turn to face him, and shamble on in a new direction, until after a silent time they crest what months prior had been a factory, but now serves them only as a hill of stone and memory. Below yawns a pit a mile across, a forever deep; precisely what they came for. "Tbylhn, kh'jhol," One drawls. "Wfrih vdm," another replies.

One descends the mount, crossing by a quivering family of survivors and hauling up the youngest by the throat in one effortless motion. The strangled thing claws desperately at the cracked and ashen hand that grips him, until at last it releases its hold -- and tosses him into the abyss. The offender turns his skull-helmet back to the survivors, whose expressions begin to show through their numbness the weakest inflections of fright.

The sacrifice's screams serve to gauge how deep the hole is, and as expected, his howls never die but rather fade, until after some time -- the Northerners nod to one another -- they join a chorus deep in the belly of the maw, an almost imperceptible orchestra of terror and madness: screams from victims of every age and caste ring in monstrous harmony, shepherded by deep and otherworldly whispers.

The one at the edge huffs. "Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Yeth Ln'dwon wgah'nagl fhtagn."

### Spring 1899

#### From the journal of Avdei Novikov:

Never run. That's what they wait for, the moment you become nothing more than a frightened animal and start to run. The moment you become the fox to their dogs. The game for their hunt.

Crossing ancient battlements, a Scottish dun I presumed, through fog so thick I could hardly see the hands at the ends of my arms, I heard fall suddenly a volley of shots and shouts. I ducked down beneath the cover of the stones and listened. Beyond, the volleys continued, and, following gaps of unnatural silence, the crash of artillery rounds. Such a calamitous din one thinks would be more audible from so close, but prior to that moment I profess in earnest there was nothing where now I was surrounded by war.

As if by divine illumination, the clouds parted and the fog thinned, allowing light to paint the battlefield with a vibrancy I had not seen on earthly features since coming to this forsaken land. The fog's bleaching white dissipated to reveal a valley drowned in late-winter snows, where the players of this blood-drama seemed to trudge through a void blank save for themselves, their arms, and their dead.

On one side, English villagers hefted aged rifles, some having donned the red coats of their forefathers. They took cover behind other sections of the broken dun distant from myself and exchanged shots with a force farther off than I could recognize. But even where I could not see them closely, their superiority was obvious: somewhere in the distance their artillery pounded the meager resistance, while their black-suited infantry pressed stalwartly forward, not in rows or squadrons but as rogue individuals, taking cover where they could, kneeling in the open to take shots. Their tactics were strange, almost sacrificial: cover was used, but sparingly, though for such military recklessness I counted few bodies as compared with the rapidly thinning ranks of villagers.

A shell smashed the dun and the back of the resistance, and in its wake rang out cries of retreat. As blood and earth rained around them from the blast, the aggressors rushed forward to catch their fleeing prey. One knelt by where I hid to take a shot, and I saw his terrible form. Huddling behind the rocks, watching him through time-worn cracks and crags, and I saw the weapon of this new England. Heavy black pelts and hides hung on him, easily doubling his apparent size, shaking and whipping with his movements like long fur. I could see nothing of his body beneath such coverings: even his feet were bound in midnight skins, his head hidden in a helm of ashen steel, shaped like the face of a sleek hound bleached white and ghastly. How he saw through it, I do not know.

As soon as his knee hit the snow, a bullet tore through the ranks of the defeated to strike this beastly specimen through his shoulder, dislocating it and ravaging the flesh and muscle therein. I know where the shot landed because I saw it burst through the other side; I know it dislocated the limb because I saw him grab it and, with a sickening crack, jerk it back into place. He took his aim again, fired his weapon into the fog, and picked off one of those fleeing. Then, with a snort and huff, he lifted himself and hurried further into the distance unfazed.

I did not imagine such alien things would take prisoners, and even in such a case I preferred to avoid such a fate. I slid back into the hills behind me, further towards the coast where, if that fool Nietzsche is wrong and my god yet breathes, I can find passage off this forsaken land. But in the weeks since that first battle, I have seen many more just like it: rag-tag resistance obliterated by the superhuman, inhuman might of these... things. I do not know what to call them yet. Soldiers? No, soldiers do not shrug off mortal wounds, relocate severed joints, charge headlong through artillery, or rip the limbs from their foes like little girls plucking petals...

### Fall 1899

#### From the journal of Avdei Novikov:

I can see the ships on the horizon. Now it is only a matter of time.

After two weeks wandering through desolate wintry passes, blasted battlefields, ruined cities and makeshift graveyards, I reached the coast. I saw one other human in that time, one other human not armed and engaged, not in the process of being blown apart by the supernatural force of his enemy. His name was Jonathan, a civilian excused from the resistance due to lack of guns. He fled his home when he saw them -- the Black Dogs, he called them -- beating down the pass to his village. He was fast and he was cowardly, and so he survived to hear the screams of his every friend and lover as he fled.

But they still haunted him, he claimed. He held his head and moaned, 'I can hear them, Avdei, still screaming and howling.' I put my hand on his shoulder, but he shoved it away and said, 'No, not the humans. The dogs.'

'I see their faces in my dreams, white fur stained black and grey, blue eyes turned sickly and yellow. They do not growl, Avdei, nor bark or pant. They are just waiting for me...'

I told him his trauma had broken him, that time and rest would stitch his grievous wounds. But ever along our treks he would stop with a jump and a shout, falling to his knees, trembling at the foliage. 'There! Didn't you hear it? They're hunting me!' He would grab my hands and plead through tears, 'They'll kill me when they get the chance, Avdei, kill me like all the rest. You can't stay. Go without me, or else they'll hunt you too.' Knife in hand, I would search for wolves or signs thereof. I found it suspicious only that I found no signs of life of any kind save the sickly foliage itself, but those curiosities I kept secret. That there was nothing was all Jonathan needed to know.

But I should have heeded the poor thing. Eventually, they caught him by surprise, leaping from the earth itself upon him. I swore it to be a huge black hound, springing from beneath the snow and grabbing Jonathan in his frothing maw before darting further into the forest. I chased after the thing, rifle in hand, following Jonathan's screams until my legs churned with fire and my lungs felt ashen. Only then did I come upon him; only then did the screams fade.

His clothing was unrecognizable through the blood, torn and destroyed all over, matted to his body by the wetness. His body lay shattered and broken, bent at gross angles. His left arm was missing; his right leg too, from the knee down. His other limbs twisted as if they had a joint every few inches, the bone poking through where it saw fit. The hound had made of him a plaything while it waited for me.

I only recognized Jonathan by his face, half of which was peeled away to the skull. But the features that remained spoke of the horror Jonathan had done his best to forget. I had led him here, to his doom, by telling him to forget. I would not make the same mistake. I would not do his memory that dishonor.

A branch snapped in the distance and I looked to see two of the black-suited, dog-masked warriors hurrying through the woods away from us. I raised my rifle and felled one of them as the other darted off in another direction. Approaching the body I found no man-corpse, but the still body of a dark-furred basset hound.

Another week and I would find the coast. Five days more and a roving schooner escorting survivors to mainland Europe would find me. And before long, I was in Belgium. I set down my arms, bathed and ate proper, and drank coffee for the first time in months. I bought a quill and ink and recanted my first encounters with the Black Dogs. My hands yet quiver, even after almost a week of rest.

But this morning, standing on the pier in the haze of oceanic dawn, I saw their ships. Ghastly galleons, motley war vessels with broken masts and rotten sails, hole-ridden hulls patched with alien metals, and the crews... I could not see them with my eyes, or even through the whorfmaster's telescope, but I could feel their eyes on me, hunting yellow eyes...

It is only a matter of time.

### Spring 1900

#### “Tzar Dreaming”

Five envoys you send to England, one after the other for months and months, and only one returns.

Of the party's ten, only three remain living. Three, say the survivors, were devoured by wild dogs. A fourth of the party murdered two of his compatriots in their sleep, and fought to kill the rest until he himself was dead. The seventh muttered something about "voices from the pit" and wandered off, immovable as if held in a trance. The three that remain are a broken band, who recount a tale you cannot move yourself to accept. 

There is no government in England, no semblance of order to be heard of. Leaving the ship that brought them in the care of its sailors, they followed what their most recent maps told them was the road to London. What they beheld there... when asked to describe it, they look at each other quietly before hanging their heads in silence. 

One offers, "London is no more. England is no more."

"And the ship? What about the sailors?" you ask. 

"All dead. Gored. Something had smashed the ship's hull. Something big."

"Something that smelled like dog piss," another adds.

"How did you get back?"

They look at each other again. You can't tell if they know something but won't divulge it, or are themselves confounded just as much as you.

"I don't know." One heaves a sigh, puts his hands on his face and shakes his head. "I don't know."

For their mental scars, the survivors are of no use to you any more, and so you discharge them until they have healed sufficiently. You think hard on whether to send another party, or whether to move against England for killing your envoys, until a dream too vivid for the name answers allays your fears.

You open your eyes to total darkness. You try to lift your hand and check if your eyes are open at all, but the limb -- all your limbs are held fast to the earth. Your breath grows quick and your skin clammy with sweat. Of all your faculties, only your voice seems to continue functioning, but the sound is weak and tinny through your paralyzed lips.

"Shhh," a voice penetrates the abyss, and you see a glint of light reflect off of something in front of you. A long, thin claw graces your cheek and exhaled air crosses your ear, "Fear does not become you."

The Kremlin flashes before your eyes. The Russian people toiling on their farms, in the streets of Moscow and Scandinavia. A soldier salutes you, and the vision is gone. "Yes. This is the one," another voice bellows from nearby, deep and affected as if arriving through water.

"He wonders of England." A third growls, as if through the voice of a dog who had learned to speak. The second burbles, "England?"

"The mortal nation, the island-people. Tzar, fear you nothing. England is no more."

Like the Kremlin before it, London appears in your mind. Massive factories and sprawling residences, the mighty capital of an imperial empire, until the vision shakes and rumbles. The earth beneath the city begins to crumble, and the gray sky cries black tears. The royal palace sinks with the ground below it, falling into itself with a roar that shakes the city, then plummeting into the abyss. A wet groan from the pit ripples across the whole metropolis. People flee their homes only for others to crush them, as others clutch their ears in agony, trying to keep the infernal, beyond-hearing chorus just beneath the groan from invading their thoughts. Days flash by and sprawling London has become a sprawling waste. Edinburgh, Liverpool, even the cities of Belgium flash in your mind, all marked with the same overwhelming destruction.

A fourth voice coughs, cracked and fiery like burning wreckage, "Gytrash, you cause him only horror. Fleshy thing, if it were my choice-"

"And for good reason it is not," Gytrash snaps. A silence follows, and for a moment you wonder if you are alone again, before Gytrash's scentless breath again passes over you, "Beneath Holland sleeps another of us. That is our object, not your Russia. Your shores are safe from our fleets, your people safe from our weapons. Fear you nothing, tzar, and dream you sweetly."

Claws click and your eyes open. Morning light washes over the room and the scent of blooming flowers calms your senses. Beside you, your pet borzoi Alena stirs to life. She yawns, and you smile at her simple animal expression, such a calming thing beside such vivid nightmares, beside the frustrations of war and politics. But when her eyes open again and rest on yours, you hear again the voice of airy Gytrash: "For when next we meet, we'll never be far. Never out of dream's reach."

### Fall 1900

#### From the journal of Avdei Novikov:

I killed one today. I watched it die. They were creeping down a hill to ambush the Dutch resistance in the village below when hostilities started. We ambushed them first, buying the civilians time to flee. We thought we would die there. Part of me hoped I would.

But I caught a black dog through the eyes. His helm punctured, he slumped to his knees. I reloaded my gun with a fevered quickness that now felt so natural, but when rather than standing back up the body fell flat, I was shocked. Somewhere, I remembered, these demons were still human.

We won today. I saw them retreat. The younger soldiers could not understand my confusion. "We've won! We've beaten them back!" "No. Nothing stops them." But with a foot on my kill, I forced myself to believe something could.

There are more of them now. Stranger things than just the black dogs. Yeth hounds, the witches of Disen... Sailors report waves like hands rising from the sea and tearing asunder steel juggernauts thought unsinkable like ashen twigs effortlessly crushed, and tooth'd shades diseasing their foodstuffs and infesting the weak-willed with fatal dreams.

Dreams... It's the first thing new recruits complain about. "I've been having these weird dreams..." they say, like a teary-eyed child come to his mama after a bad nightmare. We warn them, "Don't listen. Whatever they say -- voices from the pit, knowledge from the stars, riches beyond reason, might inconceivable -- they're demons, boy. Just demons." We lay a hand on their shoulders to try and make them believe us, really believe us, but we know it's no use. Either the boys are men and only death will stop them, or one morning they're up and gone.

Even for the veterans, the dreams remain. They tell you more as your resistances grow: they show you their cities, forges churning day and night with unholy fires, training grounds where the hounds hunt prisoners for game, and at the center, the hole... Two years ago I saw the one in London, where the thing I now know as Yeth lay sleeping. Now London is a burning war-machine, where Yeth's groans whip his warped cultists and broken captives into ever-deepening insanity. I've suffered them for two years now. I know their names, and I have seen their faces. I will say no more of them; I cannot face the thought.

I will fight until I die, but this hell has changed me. If anything like peace ever graces Earth again, I will have no place in such a land. Even as I fight them, these Old Ones have become an integral part of my continued existence. Without them, I am insane, a cold and paranoid killer, a danger to my fellow man. But while they yet live, I am a paragon of wisdom and willpower... and for far too many, the only hope for survival.

### Spring 1901

#### From the diary of Dr. Wilhelm Abendroth:

##### March 16th

"Avdei and his men brought one in alive today. A yeth hound, fur red with blood, horns dirtied with gore. Avdei claimed they had knocked it unconscious, but the slowly-regenerating bullet hole in its neck suggested otherwise. I paid them well, as promised, but to one of Avdei's subordinates. He wouldn't talk to me directly. 'Do you know how many men died for this?' I overheard him whisper, 'Twelve men, for one, just one of these abominations. No price is worth twelve of my men.'

This isn't about your men, Avdei. This is about every man. This is about survival."

##### March 17th

"I've never seen one this close. I watched from two hilltops over as their kind crushed my beloved Holland, but I couldn't make out their faces then. I saw their cannons striding on six iron legs across the broken earth, blasting recklessly into the distance, while beneath their feet waves upon waves of screaming warriors flooded my compatriots. I ran, then, and never looked back. I dedicated my powers of analysis and understanding to our resistance against these demons, and six months later, here I am, staring down one of the monsters that obliterated my homeland.

I had thought that maybe the English had simply been overcome by some nouveau-pagan craze, marking themselves with battle-paint or scarring themselves for luck with spirits, but no. This is not a man. These are horns bulging from the skull; these teeth are longer and more jagged than anything to ever grace a human jaw. Fur appears on the body in spirals and swirls in unnerving patterns. This is no man. This is a demon."

### Fall 1901

#### From the research notes and journal of Dr. Wilhem Abendroth (deceased), released for public consumption by the German Government's Department of Public Affairs:

##### Experiment 01

**Subject: Yeth Hound of London Origin**

**Codename: 01**

Notes: Battlefield reports describe the hounds as the raider counterparts of the impenetrable black dogs. They rush ahead of the advance, sweep around the flanks, and ambush envoys and scouts with a superhuman speed and ferocity. Although armed with a rifle, hound victims typically feature stab-wounds and extensive slashing, from either the hound's bayonet or disease-ridden claws. Where black dogs are silent, yeth hounds fill the battlefield with their howls. Reports describe sudden insanity resulting from the din. Precautions taken: hound gagged and muzzled to prevent howling, lashed to padded cell wall to prevent excessive movement or self-destructive acts.

Purpose: [confidential]

**Director: Dr. Wilhem Abendroth**

##### March 17th: Experiment Begins

Day One: Observation.

Early observation occurred as 01 remained sedated. When 01 awoke, it struggled briefly against its constraints and attempted to howl, but found it could only gurgle against the gag. Thereafter it calmed itself to wait and watch us as we watched it. Some of the others departed under the creature's stare, citing how it unnerved them. Others expressed fascination at the creature's bizarre and alien construction. 01 has since made no noise or movement after its initial struggle, except for its head to swivel and track its observers.

##### March 18th

Day Two: Observation (cont'd)

Researchers [confidential], [confidential], and [confidential] have departed from the project, citing unnerving dreams that they refused to believe were the work of 01. Researcher [confidential] was found taking observation notes in the dark by the time the other researchers arrived. Questioned, and he expressed intense curiosity about 01. Asked why in the dark, and he grew flustered. Wards [confidential] and [confidential] assigned to observe the doctor's mental health.

##### March 25th

Day Nine: Death #2

Burned [confidential]'s body. Kept the hound tranquilized the whole day while the cage's glass barriers were replaced and further reinforced. The restraints were similarly strengthened. Dr. [confidential] continues to defend the hound, claiming its victim provoked it. I cannot help but note that both wards assigned to monitor his mental state are now dead by the hands of the hound. I cannot help but note that [confidential]'s eyes gleam yellow in the light. More researchers vacated the project: nine remain, from an original twenty-six.

##### March 26th

Day Ten: Observation (cont'd)

After nine days of no food or water, 01 continues to exhibit no signs of starvation or dehydration. We were hoping to do an autopsy by now, but with its continued longevity, we are helpless except to observe. [confidential] suggested we simply kill it and do one anyway. Once again lashed to the wall, 01 returned to its familiar habit of tracking us with those unblinking eyes. I have almost gotten used to them. Almost.

##### March 30th

Day Fourteen: Death #3

Awoke this morning to the sound of a rifle. I hurried out of my room, pistol in hand, to see [confidential] reloading his rifle over the body of another researcher, both their lab coats smattered with blood. He whipped his head around and saw me, and I his face. Piss-yellow eyes burned in his sockets, his face seemed longer and his teeth protruded beyond the lips; his hair had grown wild and patchy, and poking through the ragged mop there, two small gazelle horns. A force of hate and fear deeper than any sensation and faster than any reflex fired my pistol. The bullet shattered his right humerus, and with a scream he dropped his weapon. He grit his teeth and growled as I rushed the wounded thing. I saw in his vengeful eyes the same demon glare as 01, as the monsters that destroyed Holland, and by God when I tackled him I did my best to crush his throat. By some miracle, though, I merely knocked him unconscious, so that in the moments thereafter, as other researchers rushed in to examine the sound of gunfire, we were able to further sedate him, and properly care for his victim's corpse.

##### March 30th

Day Fourteen (second entry)

Spent day debating what to do with [confidential] now that he's begun to turn. Some are addressing him as 02. I abstained my vote, but others suggested everything from public execution to observing inter-demon mating habits. Will bury [confidential] tomorrow.

##### March 31st: Experiment Begins

**Experiment 02**

**Subject: Partially-Turned Yeth Hound of Kiel Origin**

Codename: 02

Purpose: [confidential]

Director: Dr. Wilhem Abendroth

Lashed 02 to the cage wall alongside 01. Observations begin. Intending to feed 02 in order to better observe the turning process while continuing to starve 01. Of the five researchers that remain, none are unnerved by 02's pleas for mercy. We see his demon eyes; we know his demon heart; we know precisely how much mercy it has earned.

[Dr. Wilhelm Abendroth died five days later when a gas tank exploded in the labs. The incident damaged the facility beyond recovery.]

### Spring 1902

#### “Kaiser: Birth of an Alliance”

"Demon" does not do this thing justice. Your eyes burn just to perceive him.

Black and translucent lashes whip from his body and lick the air around him like hungry half-existing tentacles. Eyes white as bone or death or the hottest fires sear you with his gaze, while rotting, rancid flesh clings to his starving body. Black furs and leathers sewn in pieces shroud his calves, forearms, and torso, but the rest of his sickly skin hangs exposed. Hooves for feet and horns driven out of his forehead make justifiable the name satan-spawn, but something deep and dark in you tells you Lucifer holds no candle to this abomination. But for all his terrible shape, it is his grin that will take you to your grave, that you will remember even at the gates of beyond.

"Kaiser," he begins, "My name is Gytrash, and I am a reasonable man. So, in the name of peace, let us reason."

He had forced himself into your office, the doors bowing open at his approach as if welcoming him, as if he'd been invited. His smirk disarms you; the three armed guards beside you seem distant and inadequate before this thing of horror.

"Man?" you find yourself scoffing, even as terror grips you, "You are nothing but a plague on this Earth, and I will see you removed."

"Oh, that's unfortunate. Are you sure?"

"Guards, kill this ghoul!"

Three rifles rise and fire, and -- beyond your wildest expectations -- the intruder slumps. Bullets tear through him like any mortal, and now his bloody corpse stains your rug. His otherworldly features vanished when he fell, so that only the half-starved body of an oddly-clothed Englishman lies before you now.

Stories trickling back from the war's front claimed England was no more, that its people had been consumed by some demonic darkness, warping their lands and twisting their bodies. You had seen war in your youth, and know the way myths propagate, the way soldiers speak of their enemies to justify the murder they must commit every day. You had assumed that's what the stories were, but seeing this... Even as mundane as his corpse looks now, you know what you saw. The guards saw it too, didn't they? Then so will the people know, to guard themselves, to resist their blight, to triumph-

"Heh," one guard says. You turn to him, the youngling called Neals, and see... that smirk. His eyes wander the room in helpless panic, as his lips curl into that... /grin/... as the nightmarish wisp-whips lick from his body to grace the air once more. "I offer you peace. Your people will be spared death, even offered life and glory at our side."

You rise, grabbing a pistol from your belt, "I will not see my people become pawns to your evil!" Neals' lips laugh as you press the gun to his forehead, but his eyes grow only more frantic.

"Become? You say it as if it hasn't already happened." Rifles cock behind you, and you turn in time to see your bodyguards' yellow-tinted eyes glaring at you, rifles poised for your murder.

Beneath Gytrash's laughter, you hear one whisper, "I'm sorry, my lord," and fire.

### Fall 1902

#### Somewhere in Northern France.

"ALLEZ ALLEZ ALLEZ!" Lieutenant Beaulieu cried from further down the row, mounting the trench wall with a hundred others. It would be the last thing I ever heard him say.

The roar of artillery fire behind us, the shouts and shots of comrades beside us -- they tried to train us for that, but no matter your preparations every man pisses himself the first time. The howls in the distance, otherworldly cries and screams like the voices of vicious, incongruous creatures that ought never have passed the veil into our tranquil reality -- they didn't mention that in training. But looking back, I can understand why: they were trying to forget. 

I leapt above the trench, adrenaline coursing through my veins, only to see a bullet tear through the lieutenant's throat. He flipped back like a tossed ragdoll and moved no more. But save for the glances of passing soldiers, we graced his death with no note. There were more pressing issues at hand than our lack of leaders.

The sea-ward horizon was thick with demon-kind. Shapes as tall as the sky hulked in the blackened distance. Their lurching steps shook the earth at my feet. Closer to our vision hurried on soldiers, hundreds of them, as tall as two men, hidden beneath shimmering layers of black leather and midnight fur. Long wolven masks of steel shrouded their faces, making them all the more beastly, and all the less human. "CHIENS NOIRS" someone shouted, dripping with fear. I raised my rifle to take a shot when a biplane's screaming propeller drew my attention skyward. An unoccupied Nieuport slammed into the earth, while above great winged half-men tore its pilot apart with long grasping claws. His screams pierced the din more than any other sound, and I aimed my rifle at those harpies as much to save him as to silence him. The first shot got their attention and they forgot their prey, dropping him an easy five hundred feet, while from another direction more like-minded Frenchmen gave them better shots, and I was given the pleasure of seeing a harpy killed. Bullets pelted her until by good fortune one slammed into the back of her skull, and the bloodied mess plummeted to the earth. The other flew from the scene, while a celebratory whoop rose in our ranks over the fallen demon. But no inspiration lasts long here; the demons don't allow it.

I lowered my eyes to the horizon in time to see the black dogs begin firing. They held no simple rifles in those huge hands, no: each black dog wielded a whole machine gun, altered for hand-held operation.

Such weapons were too large for us to be operated in any less than teams of three; my own rifle was a simple semi-auto. Our charge was short-lived, as I and anyone else with half their wits leapt back into the trenches as the black dogs rained steel on our ranks. I watched as men scrambling back to safety were cut down, sawed apart by the demon's munitions. Even those who dared to raise their head up to observe their foes found his bullets between their eyes. A poor fool turning mad beside me chuckled, "Regardez-vous cela? Je le ris, parce qu’ils sont seulement la commencement."

Like Beaulieu before him, that would be the last thing he would ever say to me, as something blood-red and screaming dropped into the trench in front of us and rammed a jagged bayonet through his chest. It paused for the merest shade of an instant, and I made eye contact. Searing yellow corneas, black and ashen pupils -- I felt the paralyzing sorrow and suffering of something deep beneath those eyes. The skeptics preached that the demons of England were just rumors, that in truth their soldiers had been captured by some nouveau-pagan craze and in battle exhibited a ferocity unknown to the more civilized. The doomsayers argued the demons were just that: Satan´s subjects and followers. But here I saw the truth. I saw a boy named Allen, nary seventeen, whose adolescence had been interrupted by terrifying dreams and warped visions. I saw his mother suffer the same, while his father looked on with increasing horror at the changes of his family. I saw them both tear him apart, limb from limb as he cried out in confusion more than pain. I saw them wandering toward London while the changes consumed them, until at their arrival they had become the kinds of beasts I saw before me now. Unseen voices compelled them onto transport ships crafted from incongruous alien metals, and months later here they were, murdering men they had never known before. I saw Allen crying inside the yeth hound´s skin, crying for his father, for his victim now, for his own state...

I rammed my bayonet through his heart. Then again through a lung, then the throat, then wherever my trembling hands landed the infernal tool. Allen howled to the heavens, and as I withdrew my weapon one final time, his gore covering its front, I fired a round through his eyes. His head shot back, then slumped forward and looked at me while the hole in his head oozed black. The yellow of his eyes turned white, the black into a softer brown, and the sparse red fur on his scalp turned a slight blond. His malformed lips withdrew from their hateful grimace, becoming a soft contentment, before he slumped, dead, to the side.

"Bon," a voice nearby shouted, "Mais il y a deux milles plus de lui pas loin d´ici, et aussi ses frères. Suis-moi, et nous survivrons."

And so I did.

### Spring 1903

#### “Exposed”

Following a secret deal between the Turks, who had allied themselves with the Austrians, who were demon-kind's last major foe, to expose the coordinated battle plans of the Germans, Italians, and English as they marched on Spain and Eastern Europe:

- - -

You are Ahmad Mehmet, Turkish envoy to Austria, and you are hunted.

You know they hunt you because you see it in your dreams, because you watch the trail of bodies grow ever closer, the trail of sin, of guilt.

First they caught Canan Kent, the envoy to England. Bite-marks colored his limbs where they hung, dismembered, at Constantinople's palace gates. His head was left facing the throne, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, with twisted and alien calligraphy scarred into his face, repeating in a script you could not bare to read, "SMALL MAN. SMALL PREY."

Then Irmak Emir, the Minister of the Exterior, of Foreign Affairs, whose hands the report must have gone through. His body, they found bloated in his home's garden pools, whose water bubbled black and acidic, while its lush foliage had twisted into wicked and unnatural shapes: the leaves were sharp enough to draw blood, the bark weak and fickle. The tree-trunks hunched over the scene from high overhead like sinister judges. Carved in Irmak's back read those same unnerving words, "SMALL MAN. SMALL PREY."

One by one, every pair of hands the report passed through turned up dead -- aides, analysts, diplomats and envoys... whoever had touched it, they were dead now. Dead save you, having long since fled the capital. Deeper into the deserts of the East you voyaged through the summer sun, pawning your every possession in desperate flight from an enemy you only hoped could be outrun. First you hid at your cousin's home in Armenia, until over a quiet tea dinner she rose with a scream and you watched invisible coals sear her forehead with the words, those words, those dreaded words. You fled while she yet howled. You hope mercy graced her death.

Then to Syria, where the Muslim Muezzin cried from the minarets the call to prayer, each taking his own creative license to add the phrase, "FOR ALLAH MAKES OF SMALL MEN SMALL PREY, ALLAH BE BLESSED. ALLAH BE PRAISED." Even outside the cities, where you imagine they must have agents and spies, you see them on the dunes: spectral wisps in the summer heat, or night-time tricks of the moonlight, but after such a trail of death you are sure these are no tricks. You are sure the wolf over the dune's crest comes every day and night just for you. You are sure his eyes, yellow as the sickliest pus and piercing like the coldest steel, watch only you. You are sure he has friends, other wolves over other dunes who watch you all the same.

Even sleep is no reprieve. There they are not kept from you by distance; there they hunt you ever harder. Your dreams evoke the wolf again, but looking closer it is just a sleek dog. He stands proud from the shadows, form hidden save for his demon eyes, while you run or scream or bellow... or as of late, cry. Where first you raged and threatened the beast, thinking yourself untouchable, as the bodies mounted -- and mounted too in the dream, until the beast's eyes were joined by those of your dead comrades, yearning for you to join them -- you fled with a vigor lost to you since first making love in your adolescence, returned to you now in old age not in pursuit of life's pleasures but in flight from horrors that mock and bloody every treasure left of the living. 

Now, after half a year of running, you find yourself deep in the sandy wastes of the Arabian desert. In your dreams you do not resist, you do not even run when the dog comes. You cry. You fall on your knees and beg for mercy, tears streaming down your weary features. But when you awake, nothing. Even when you submit, there is no reprieve. Your tormentor remains just over the last dune. His howls still pierce the night, even as no other living thing graces these sands for a hundred miles in every direction.

Except this night. Six months after you first fled the capital, seven after the dreams began, this dream is different. You beg on your knees, bowing before this terrible mutt and howling for forgiveness, from him, from the bodies of your friends and family as their empty, ghastly eyes take audience beside the hound.

"I gave them the report! I gave them the information! I know it was me, I know, I know, the battle plans for Germany, Italy, even our own Turkish force. Tormentor, you know I exposed us, you know, why do you not leave it at that? Give me death, give me peace. But please, by whatever sovereign grace my Lord possesses, end this, I beg you."

The mutt strides forward, the corpses behind him fading into darkness until it remains only you and him. He approaches until you can feel his breath, warm like rotten bodies, and see into his eyes, deep with twisted sights, and in a voice emanating from the very space around you, whispers, "No."

You awake once more in Constantinople's busy streets, carried by your arms by two hulking warriors, their forms shrouded beneath heavy layers of black furs and leathers. Steel helms, shaped like the wolf from your dreams, hide their faces. They haul you effortlessly through the thoroughfares that lead to the palace gates, roads and ways that normally throng with bustle and business but who by the sight of these two beasts have been made silent. Citizens watch stunned at the spectacle.

The clinking of chains behind you makes you turn your head to see the other victims, the bodies from your dreams, revived to shamble like prisoners. They still bear the wounds of their murders: the drowned remain wet and bloated, the burned ashen, while dismembered victims are dragged in baskets behind those who can yet walk. They do not look at you, only stare ahead with slack jaws and dead eyes.

Before the palace gates rise hanging posts enough for every victim here -- save one. For him you notice a chopping block, and beside it a long and jagged scimitar, rusted and evil. There the beasts toss you, while one takes the prisoners to the posts and the other presses your neck into the block's notch, holding you there by force. You scan the crowd, your eyes pleading. I am sorry, your gaze whispers, Save me. Hundreds of them are watching, as far in every direction as you can see.

You call out for help, screaming and crying, to no avail. The spectators are immovable. Women put their hands over their mouths, while fathers usher their boys home. "Go on now," they say, "You don't want to see this." Your cries grow shriller, more desperate, until beside you shambles up a beast only vaguely resembling the most wicked of men. He dons the same furs and corpse-skins as the brutes holding you down or tying up the others, but his skin is not hidden by it. His greasy, pimpled chest shines proudly in the sun, while his forearms bear bloats and tumors to make them seem gargantuan. His face, however, he hides beneath a bone-white bull-skull, the horns pointing out like menacing daggers. He looks over the crowd before peering on you. You can't see his eyes, but you feel his gaze on you as your breath is snatched away and mid-sentence your pleas turn to silence.

He takes a parchment from his side and turns back to read it. "Here assembled," he cries, "are traitors, thieves, liars, and murderers. They have stolen from their allies a precious secret, knowledge of plans and alliances, and endangered every one of us. None of you can afford this risk, to be sold out by your own leaders. Such a thing, England refuses to let pass. England looks after its friends, but turns its enemies to dust.

"Every man here has knowingly turned your secrets over to your enemies. We have dealt with them once in private, destroying them as a matter of necessity. Where our secrets leaked, we plugged the holes. We do this now to illustrate the price of such foolishness. This man, the one called Ahmad Mehmet, shall forever be the most reviled of this lot, for his hands were the last Turkish pair to touch our secrets, the one who could have stopped his machine of lies so easily, with a simple refusal, a simple dedication to his home, to his nation. Instead he sold you, sold Rumania, and sold Bulgaria. So here he lies."

Behind you, the sound of nooses snapping taut whips out over you as their victims fall to their second deaths. "So, Ahmad Mehmet, I and the powers vested in me by Resurgent Confederacy of England and her allies, do hereby find you and all present behind us guilty of treason to the crowns of England, Germany, Italy, and Turkey all."

The beast beside you lets his hand off your neck, but your attempts to scramble to your feet are met with no ground. You cannot lift your neck, even as nothing holds it down. You try to scream, to beg and plea once more, but no air escapes your lips. You are only able to produce hot and furious tears that sear your cheeks as the demon takes the scimitar from beside you.

"I sentence all convicted here to death for high treason. Traitorous scum, may you find Hell fitting."

The demon raises the weapon and, with a hard thwack, removes you of your body. The world spins as your head falls to the sand and dust, but death does not liberate you. You watch helplessly as blood gushes from the stump, while your executioner grasps your head in one mighty hand and, drawing out a basket woven of bark-ash, places you inside and hangs the basket on the palace gate's spikes.

"But Mehmet, you will suffer an especial punishment, for having been the final instrument in this terrible orchestra. Your still-living, still-watching head is to be hung on the palace gates, so that all who pass shall know the price of betrayal. Your silent screams and empty pleas shall serve to remind those you betrayed the cost of such insolence. And when the sun has flaked away all your skin and the crows have left you nothing but bone and gristle, then and only then shall death free you from your mortal torment to Hell's immortal torture. May it suit your despicable deeds."

He rolls up his parchment once more and stuffs it away at his side while the two shrouded warriors move to him, one carrying your body and the other the scimitar, as you watch from behind the charcoal bars of your new prison the crowd part for their exit, and shortly thereafter disperse. Your comrades, dead a second time, swing in the breeze at your sides. A boy comes closer to spit on you, and from a space just inside your skull you hear the hound one last time:

"Your impatience for power will serve you no good here. Eternity," he echoes, the smile evident in his voice, "Is a long, long time."

### Fall 1903

#### Excerpt from the journal of Jean-paul Sacre-cour:

"Hanged men line the forest's sickly boughs, their crimes carved in the trees below in a wicked script that causes the mind to shake when read. Some of our men are Ruhr natives, Germans and Dutchmen Avdei recruited. They remember when these forests shone verdant, when the creeks and streams ran clear and blue. Now they contain only blackened sludge, putrid and toxic, while the trees have grown twisted and sinister. A lesser man would try to ignore them watching, but we are survivors in this dark age. We watch them right back. 

Every one of us has seen the demons close, killed them too. Most of us did it with our bare hands. Wilhelm Abendroth, a former German scientist, says he set his research laboratory ablaze when he started to see his assistants turn. He watched nearby Holland fall with his own eyes. The fury I see in him when he falls on demons, it is incredible. His is hatred, pure and unbidden.

We share no common language. Our ranks, maybe fifty-some, come from every part of France, the Netherlands, Germany, Scandanavia, and even the frigid wastes of what we once called Russia. Avdei translates when he must, but for the most part we share no words. What is there to say? "I watched hellspawn bring human civilization to its knees. I will have revenge."? No. Such a thing need not be said. Such a thing, we all assume. We all know.

We will have revenge."

### Spring 1903

#### Excerpt from the journal of Jean-paul Sacre-cour:

*“I see you.”*

France is lost.

*“Every one of you.”*

Russia is lost.

*“Your hopes...”*

Spain is lost.

*“Your dreams...”*

We are all that remains. Two ferries of armed resistance, maybe 100 soldiers in all. Fathers, mothers, their eldest children, too – anyone with wit enough to kill, and will enough to resist the dreams. We share stories at night, brief and quiet words, of the lives we once led, the things we aspired for. We make-believe that we'll ever be able to return to such lives. 

*“Your lives...”*

We made contact with a French regiment in southern Belgium. They were in retreat from an encounter with German forces in the Ruhr. They were an army beaten and torn. Their ranks were thin – many were missing their weapons. They hauled no artillery, marched on foot with only a handful of bullet-torn vehicles at their sides. Avdei asked their leader, a man wearing the skull of the last general as a sign of his rank, for permission to peruse his soldiers for new fighters for the Hardened. He denied him the right, but Avdei didn't listen. He muttered, “He'll be turned soon anyway. I'll save his men whether he likes it or not.”

“Turned, Avdei? Why would we leave him alive?” One asked.

“I won't do it. And I wouldn't say you should do it while we're sharing their tents, but once I'm done here,” he took a sniper's rifle from nearby and handed it to the boy, “He's all yours.”

We would collect twenty-two soldiers from their regiment of over a thousand men. Two weeks later we would get word the regiment wasn't just wiped out – it had joined the other side.

*“Your memories...”*

We found an abandoned port-town in Normandy. Ghastly were its streets; rotted corpses hung from rooftops, but any trace of demon-kind had long left this place behind. We searched the homes for supplies, smashing windows, doors, locks, and anything else to get at what we needed. An older soldier behind me laughed when I tossed a pearl necklace aside, searching through drawers for cloth to patch my meager and tattered belongings.

“What is it, Jon?” I asked.

“Those pearls? They must have been a gift to some dame for her wedding anniversary. And those drawers, Jean-paul? Those are her delicates.”

I looked at the fistful of cloth I held and, like wiping a grime from my eyes, I realized they were pantyhose.

“That little number you threw down just a moment ago,” he pointed, “She probably wore that on their honeymoon.” He picked it up and looked it over, “I bet her man was well pleased.”

Standing up, it dawned on me that once upon a time, people lived here. In the bed on the other side of the room, where someone's blood painted the walls, people once slept there, and slept there peacefully. Photos, smashed atop the wardrobe, showed a family of four: wife, husband, grandfather, and granddaughter. The faded black-and-white photographs showed them... happy... beneath a gleaming yellow sun. The daughter, barely eight years old, wasn't paying attention to the photographer. She was preoccupied by a hand-sewn doll, coming to her from the outstretched hand of her grandfather, while the mother and father looked at each other with joy beaming from their smiles. I remembered feeling something like that, looking into another human's eyes. Love. I recalled it with numb curiosity, like looking into a past life. Their daughter, however...

I hadn't seen a child alive in years. The Black Dogs were less frightening to me than the pure and naive innocence of her expression. In the corner of my eye, I saw her doll by the window. Going to it, raising it in my hands... Its right arm had been torn off, and one of its eyes was missing. The thing was old long before the Old Ones appeared, but now it looked like a relic from some ancient paradise. And the former owner, the little girl? We found her body outside the home. She had been hung from the edge of the roof until the rope rotted through and her decomposing body fell to the cobblestone earth, where we saw her limbs twisted and snapped, her flesh a sight of pestilence. 

*“Your very souls...”*

I stitched a banner from her doll. Comrades gave me keepsakes for it, until at last when we set out into the English Channel, we flew our flag against the bleak and ashen heavens. Photographs, kerchiefs, pendants, letters, and dolls like the little girl's. Some of us cried as we constructed the standards, and I for one envied them, who could keep their heart alive to feel pain even now. So many of us have been consumed by this war. Our hearts, our souls, we left behind. Avdei spoke of the sensation the dawn we arrived in England:

“Millions have died to protect a world that I can hardly remember. Six years now, I have fought every second to resist the onslaught, but even as I have come to know the voice of Gytrash or any other Old One's goading as commonplace in my dreams, I have forgotten the smell of roses in Spring, the feel of a yellow sun on my skin, the sound of a bustling market, the feeling of a lover's lips – what children look like, alive. I cannot count the number of people I have murdered to keep them from turning, or the number of demons whose bodies I have torn limb from limb in fits of battle-madness. I cannot remember a meal that did not taste like ash, a day-sky not colored like pus, or a night with stars.”

He sighs then and pauses for a moment, before picking up his rifle, “That is the world we fight for, the one so few of us can even recall. These banners, they show – no, they shout the names of every treasure Gytrash and his brethren have taken. We will take them back, brothers. We will rip them from their demon-hands and raise them to the sky and rebuild this world. It is not a world I will be a part of, friends. Peace is beyond me, beyond many of us. A world without demon-kind is a paradise I can only dream of, but the killer I have become has no place in such a world. I fight – we fight – to ensure that our descendants need never learn the harsh lessons that define our lives.”

“Now,” he locks the cartridge in his weapon, “Let's put down these dogs.”

**“I have smashed every one.”**

### Fall 1904

#### From the journal of Avdei Novikov:

At the foot of Edinburgh's furthest barricades, only three of us remained. We had been reduced in a path of blood and war across England's ashen wastes, but we fought hard, and we fought well. We evaded major troop concentrations, slew the outliers and patrols, took their weapons, and moved on. The Black Dogs and the other demon-races had changed too much to be stopped by mere human weapons, so we used theirs instead: automatic rifles small enough to be wielded by just one man, demon leathers so thick they stopped bullets, and even the Black Dog helmets. With every battle, more and more of us looked head to toe like the demons we fought, but we still carried our tattered banners of dolls and photographs, blankets and letters. Chains of wedding rings clinked around our necks. We hummed national anthems, love songs, recited plays and the words of philosophers to keep distant the din of demons howling.

War claimed most of the dead, but as we pressed on, even the most hardened among us fell susceptible to the dreams. Men turned before their comrades' eyes, their eyes turning the tell-tale color of hot piss, before out of reflex one would drive his knife into the fallen. The speed of our reactions left us to wonder if Gytrash wasn't just playing tricks, but as the corpses' faces turned sinister and rancid, we knew our training had served us well.

By the time we approached Gytrash's fortress-city of what mortals once called Edinburgh, only three of us remained: myself, the doctor Wilhelm Abendroth, and the boy Jean-Paul Sacre-Cour. Each of us carried banners on our backs stitched in the styles of our home-nation's colors: I, the motherland Russia; Wilhelm, the fatherland Germany; Jean-Paul, the fallen maiden France. These were places of myth now, buried by the Old Ones beneath their demon spires and demon factories and demon armies. But we would never forget. And now, armed with the weapons and armor of our enemies, we would fight the last deadly mile to revive the world. Gytrash no longer laughed in my dreams, only stared hard and hateful with eyes whose otherworldliness once burned me to see, but that now caused me no pain, no stress, oozed no taint, summoned no fear, who burst unmoving with horrors from every corner of existence and beyond, provoking nothing. Where he glared hard, I stared only harder. In this contest of wills, I would not be stopped.

Our explosives tore open the Southern gates, while we lay in wait at the Northern end. We scaled the Cyclopean walls into the filthy, vomitous alleyways of a demon capital. Warehouses and factories of antedeluvian design forged of stone and metal not of this earth rose around us, forming alleys between them and roads across. We could hear the footfalls of the city's soldiers like tidal waves towards the destroyed gate, leaving our path to Gytrash's pit relatively empty -- until we crossed the street and the dust at our feet began to rise. "Disen Bog Hags," Jean-Paul whispered as we moved, "They must have seen us. I can hear them cackling."

I refused to let him think what he was thinking, "Let their spells fly. We need you-"

"No. They saw me. They want me."

"Damnit Jean-Paul, I said-"

"Their magic will tear us apart so long as they know we're here. Watch the dust rise, Avdei, you know what they're casting. If one of us doesn't stop them, they'll kill us all long before we reach Gytrash, so I'm going to save your lives now whether you like it or not." He turned in the alleyway and whispered the last words I would ever hear him say as he raised his rifle, "Vive la France, vous merd-putains de l'enfer."

Wilhelm didn't stop to watch him go like I did. Instead he moved past me, hauling me by my arm until I too followed. He didn't understand French so our exchange must have been alien, but as the gunfire began seconds later he noted, "That is a brave thing he does. Drawing them away like that. But the dogs will catch our scent once he's dead. His bravery buys us time, but does not ensure us victory."

We sprinted across another block as the city's defenses doubled back to support Jean-Paul's attackers. His gunfire lasted another moment, aided by bursts and bombs, and then faded beneath more and more weapons firing on him. Gytrash snorted with pride and flashed me the image of his body, riddled with bullets and broken by Black Dogs beating his corpse. As they moved away, the hags began chanting again, and his corpse rose through the air to its feet, dancing to the inhuman laughter of his murderers. But I could feel Gytrash' anger, for I was not dismayed. Jean-Paul died gloriously: around him lay four demons in pools of their own rancid blood; the French banner flew triumphantly over his defeated, humiliated body; and as he danced, his limp right hand tugged a fishing line leading underneath his armor. A grin broke across my face and blossomed only further into wild peals of laughter as force and fire ripped through the Northern district, consuming whole blocks and hurling rubble and bodies and their parts overhead. Gytrash screamed in my head, but it was my turn to laugh now. Forty pounds of dynamite had just devoured the bulk of his defenses.

Half a mile to go and we burst into a full sprint. Demon howls shook the air around us as we ran, the pounding steps of angered Yeth Hounds leaping from rooftop to rooftop in our pursuit, as iron-walkers rose up on their six massive legs to hunt us. Their cannonfire burst around us, smashing through buildings and crushing other demons. Shrapnel stuck in our armor and pierced our skin, but we pressed on. When the Yeth Hounds fell from the rooftops to slay us, we whipped our blades into them without losing a step, catching their bodies by the necks as they dropped and hauling them out into the street as we crossed the blocks. Black Dogs bearing down on us let fire with their heavy machine guns and lay down a gauntlet of lead that tore through the demon corpses we carried like shields. But they served us well enough, and with only a few stabbing pains I dared not ponder, we tossed down our eviscerated foes and ran on -- until Wilhelm tripped.

His leg had been broken; it twisted like no leg ought. "GO." he shouted, "WE'RE SO CLOSE, AVDEI, JUST GO." This was no time to question him, so I didn't. I ran. His shouts only spurred me on. Two more blocks to cross, blocks of foes beyond number, crying out with all they had for my death, while was seemed like forever behind me I could hear Wilhem's defiant roar become a desperate plea for mercy. The world was bursting around me, and for all I knew I was bursting with it. My mind afforded me no liberty to ponder my own mortality. My purpose there was singular and impossibly necessary. No number of bullets would stop this body from reaching the pit. No force would keep me from my goal. Nothing would make Gytrash safe now.

The last alleyway. I could see the pit now, not twenty yards from me. Four Black Dogs as tall as three men and strong as twenty rushed around the edges of the pit to block my path. No. They raised their rifles to fire on me as I let loose the only thing I had in my mind to fight them with, a warcry of immortal contempt and defiance. Their bullets began to fly as Wilhelm pulled his trigger and burst with the sound and fury of a world imploding. I leapt with the explosion's force at my back and slammed into a startled demon's chest, knocking him over the edge and, at last, I plummeted into the pit.

I had seen men and women tossed into the pits before. They screamed as they fell. They cried and pleaded, begged and prayed. The demon beside me became human as he fell, his unholy features falling away as his mortal fear overcame him. He screamed like all the other mortals thrown down here, until in mid-air he burst into dust. But not this one, I thought. I would have no such fate. Saving my breathe, I straightened my body into a falling arrow. My heart still pounded with righteous might, but my nerves went cool and calm again. "This is the end, Gytrash," I thought, "This is your end."

"No!" I heard, and ground stopped my descent with a hateful crash. "Do you see me? See what I am? I am GYTRASH, you putrid whelp!"

I lay stunned for many moments, until a slender claw graced my cheek. "Commendable, that you have come all this way. But what do you intend to kill me with, hmm? Bullets? Explosions? These are what humans kill humans with. But what do you use, Avdei, to kill a god?"

Rolling on one side, I pressed my palm to the ground -- my eyes still wouldn't open, or maybe I had gone blind -- and raised myself to my knees...

"Yes! Crawl, puny thing! Crawl in the darkness! This is MY home. MINE. MY WORLD. You are a stranger in a strange land, helpless, useless, far from home, impossibly far from everything you have ever known or loved, entered into a world I have built, from which you will never return."

...and from my knees onto one leg, shot through with pain, my head screaming the motion was too much for my broken body...

"Armies rise and fall at my beck and call, Avdei! Do you understand what I am? Why you are blind? Where I am from you /cannot exist/, you are /too small/, /too weak/. Passing through the veil..."

...and from one leg to two, at last standing, then with more effort and force than my body has ever known, standing tall.

"...should have killed you." Gytrash utters, aghast. A scream at the edge of my ability to hear it, testing the walls of my sanity rings in my ears and through my mind, and an entity falls upon me. I cannot describe it, only that with my own cry of resistance I tossed it aside to crash upon the ground.

"No, Gytrash," I bellowed, "I understand precisely what you are. You are a bane upon this earth, a baleful plague and sickly pox. You do not cure disease with war, end epidemics with combat. Wherever you are from, you should have stayed there, for now you will never return. This sanctuary of yours, I will smash it and destroy you with it."

"Heh," he coughed, "But how? You are no antibody. No medicine. You are a soldier. Kill me, just /try/."

"But I am. I am precisely your antithesis: immune to your dreams, impervious to your deception, invulnerable to your attacks," I reached out and clutched his beyond-living flesh, "I am impenetrable. You are less."

With my other hand I rammed it through his ameobous form and tore at him. His screams enveloped the infinite darkness as I plunged my body into him. It was all I could think to do, but I suppose it was enough. The darkness became a light as his cries grew shriller and shriller until the whole world must have rang with his pain, until once I had suspended my whole self in his form and still remained strong, remained standing, remained triumphant, I blacked out.

I awoke I don't know how many days later in a grass field a mile wide -- the size of the pit. Beyond the field lay the broken ruins of Edinburgh, not Gytrash's demon capital. A yellow sun shone above me, and a light breeze played across the tall stalks. I sat up sore, but without seeing my wounds I must still have been in shock. But as I moved, the Black Dog armor I wore fell away to ash. The metal slivers in my hair and on my face must have been the helm. The clothing that remained -- tattered trousers, a shirt with no buttons and torn-away collar -- allowed me to inspect... nothing. Save for bruises, I had no marks of battle. The shrapnel I suffered, the bullets torn through me... nothing.

Rising to my feet, I hobbled through the grass to the ruin's edge. Bodies lay crushed beneath the rubble, but human bodies. No Black Dogs, Yeth Hounds, Bog Hags, Ysians... But plenty of ash. And as I scanned further, a broken iron-walker poking through the remains. But it was the patch of cloth hitched between two rock slabs that would lift me the most:

A flag of my mother Russia composed from blanket scraps and shreds of cloth.

We had won. It was over.

Now, a day later, I find myself reflecting on my blade. This same knife that slit a thousand throats living, dead, and otherwise, I set to cutting meat for a meal only a day ago I could never have imagined. Beneath a blue sky I roast freshly-caught venison. My journal lies some feet away, waiting for my words. Tomorrow I will dig graves, but today I must rest. It's all over now, I remind myself. But by the bloodstains on my clothes, I will never forget.
